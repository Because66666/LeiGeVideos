Forbidden Technique，Using this technique consumes stamina.，Reaching the high ground in 5 minutes，The ideal scenario is getting penalized once every three matches.，deducted 3 points at a time。

achieve sustainable development，In reality, it's three deductions in three matches，Stamina is completely depleted，The problem still lies with Meng Tian, just like before，still no tower pushing points。

This results in me having a very low rating even with over 80% tower push.，very prone to being reported，Of course, I don't think it's caused by giving away too many kills.，I think it's because Meng Tian's farming speed is too slow.，So I switched to playing Li Xin。

Li Xin has fast farming speed，As long as you farm enough gold, you won't get reported.，Ah，Just think about why I have so much money，That's because I made great contributions!。

Cutting off lanes, counter-jungling, slaying the dragon – countless battle merits deserve this reward，Why should I be reported，Here someone might say，Brother Lei，I see you've got a pile of money but haven't made any real contribution。

Never mind that, the honorable judge only cares about money, not deeds.，as long as you have enough gold，that counts as a great contribution，For example, if Hou Yi starts the game with a 0-3 score，and then stayed in the jungle farming creeps the entire game without coming out。

Even if he spends the whole game farming jungle creeps, you still can't report him.，In the end, I also developed this set of equipment through research.，Since the new version of Chicken Claw lacks penetration，so you need to build a Small Meteor first，Finally, complete it by upgrading to the Shadow Battle Axe.。

The advantage of this build is that it demolishes towers extremely fast，Of course, it's only good for attacking towers, and practically useless against anything else.，Ah，In the late game, you can not only demolish the towers，can also survive。

Dying fewer times also makes you less likely to get reported，Because my skills are completely inhuman，Unless the opponent intentionally feeds me kills，otherwise I can't get it，so I can get matched with good teammates。

In a team, the number of veteran players and noobs is fixed.，you took the spot of the veteran player，your side will have one less hardcore player，you're occupying the slot for a noob，your team will have one less noob。

Actually, I was really nervous while playing.，Each match takes 30 to 40 seconds to matchmake.，Every time I thought it would match me with someone even worse than me，to end my winning streak，Luckily, I was overthinking it.。

It turns out that people as bad as me are very rare.，Afraid that average hardcore players can't carry me，is matching me with top-tier prison players，still playing this game in the middle of the night，must all be hardcore players。

But the bigger the storm, the more valuable the fish，Ah，Why can't I bet on these imprisoned players，all spawned on our side，Luckily my gamble paid off。

Because I played so poorly，so all the veteran players are on my side，Haki King, you guy，The matching is so slow，So you're actually finding hardcore players for me。

simply unbeatable，I just glanced at the pro player in the crowd，just picked up two assists，12:4 all four kills were mine，Luckily I took up the noob slot。

Otherwise, my teammates in this match would be in danger.，Attack the tower directly，This minion doesn't have much health left.，Sigh，Okay, one more thing。

Li Xin is truly a hero who shouldn't kill anyone，0-7, 3.4，3-8, 7.5，I was almost the MVP
