视频字幕：

Zhuge Liang, what a coincidence，You're also jungling，You're farming your own jungle，I'm also farming your jungle，It seems we really have a lot in common。

But why aren't you taking the blue buff?，First time meeting，Zhuge Liang has generously given me both wolves he defeated.，It seems this Zhuge Liang is quite an honest fellow.，Han Xin has also secured the blue buff.。

You can safely retreat now.，This Great Invoker is such a tanky king，fought for so long but didn't kill，baited out a Flash，Not bad, now I have my second skill。

Watch me counterattack, giving it my all，slowed down，didn't make it over，but it's fine，The enemy Zhuge Liang won't have it easy either。

After respawning, I immediately went to take down Zhuge Liang's wolves.，I tried my best, but Grandmaster is too tanky.，A full combo only took off two health bars，but seeing that Zhuge Liang's blue buff is gone，I'm relieved。

Diaochan came to help me gank Dasiming.，I'm here to help，Seems like we can take them，No need for my help，Missed it, tried my best。

Solo kill, nice nice nice，Enemy has been slain，This Diaochan is really a good person，always helping me gank Da Siming，The enemy Grand Marshal is finally down。

We can come and take down their first turret now.，Although Lanling King's tower pushing speed isn't great，but the low rating，Taking down towers is not important，A low score is what matters。

Otherwise you won't be matched against such weak opponents，How can we keep stealing towers without matching against such weak opponents?，Come over again and help Diaochan push down the mid-lane tower.，I won't go to the top lane，Da Qiao is in the top lane。

Going there might increase my participation rate too much.，I single-handedly took down 4 of the opponent's towers，four enemy turrets，My teammates took forever but only took down one tower，Now it's 0-3。

Let's slay the dragon and then make our move.，For You to feed a few kills first，and then go to fight enemies，If you fight first and then feed，in case your teammates are too strong。

you won't have a chance to feed，your rating will increase，but if you feed first and then fight，your teammates are strong，resulting in you having no chance to engage in fights。

then your rating will actually decrease，You have slain，Come over and take out Jiang Ziya again，Get revenge for the early game，Even player Tian wouldn't dare to fight like this。

But I dare to play like this when using Lanling Wang，When playing Lancelot, as long as your kills don't exceed your deaths，the rating simply can't be high，Liu Bei will be buffed again in the next update，I'll give it a try later, the jungler chicken-feet Liu Bei。

This Liu Bei has fast dragon-slaying speed，definitely very effective，Forget about Li Bai，Without a lifesteal blade, there's zero sustain，can't defeat the dragon，Lane Li Bai builds Vampiric Scythe in the early game，just like a Blood Demon Artifact，The most important thing is not being able to gain teammates' trust
