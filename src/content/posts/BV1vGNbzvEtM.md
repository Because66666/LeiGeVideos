This match is against Cao Cao, and Li Xin was actually banned.，This account is getting stranger the more I play.，Why are Li Xin and Meng Tian banned so frequently?，Players in the King rank sure know how to play.，Now the two heroes I commonly use are often banned.。

Sometimes the opponent picks Lancelot.，or our jungler is just Lanling Wang，Sigh，Looks like I need to develop a few more heroes first.，otherwise all Me heroes might get banned or picked。

there's nothing left to play，I tried my best, damn it，I just respawned, two minutes，gave away two kills，It's fine, my teammates are also getting crushed.。

It's not just me who's getting wrecked here，Seems there's a pro on their team，This jungler is clearly here to gank me.，This Cao Cao is acting like an idiot，This is truly turning the world upside down.。

A level 5 Daji actually dares to ambush my level 7 Lancelot，a level-7 Lancelot，But now the score is 6:4，We're currently in a great lead.，Both kills were given by me。

The correct score should be 6:2，Let him go for now and come save our Annie.，Fortunately, Anivia took down the enemy jungler.，Otherwise he would have really escaped.，After all, I definitely wouldn't attack him.。

After a while, the score surprisingly became tied at 9:9.，I took a look，It turns out our support Wang Zhaojun didn't even buy the gemstone，resulting in our Houyi having only 3,000 gold，After playing for so long, the Houyi finally realized。

It seems this Houyi also has some issues，Enemy，This is completely upside down.，Daji actually ambushed my Lanling Wang，Daji, just you wait。

Control it，This kill can't be taken，Getting too many kills makes it hard to suppress the rating，The jungler seems to be struggling.，Help him out again。

Requesting backup，Good luck，Just now, both Cao Cao and the enemy jungler died，I directly sneaked and took down their high ground.，Why does this jungler always come to gank my Lanling King?。

I've already pushed to their crystal in the top lane，My teammates fought for so long and only managed to take down one mid lane tower.，Why does this jungler always want to come after me?，I see the enemy Daji.，Daji, just you wait。

Got the trade kill，Traded evenly, not a loss. The skill damage from the attack speed and crit build is too low.，plus there was no critical hit just now，Too unlucky，The enemy jungler still won't leave。

directly killed，Shut down，We probably can't take this dragon now.，This Daji is really turning the world upside down，Not afraid of my Lan Ling Wang at all, huh?。

something worthless by the roadside，Do you really think my claws aren't sharp?，You have slain an，Keep coming to ambush，This Daji is just too much, absolutely bullying me.。

Still not leaving，Our high ground turret is being destroyed，Damn, the first hit didn't crit，I tried my best，Fortunately, I just died.。

Otherwise I'd have to think about how to die，Help our jungler out a bit，This jungler even teamed up with me to backdoor.，Seems like a pro player，directly tank the tower。

Our crystal is under attack，You have been slain，Luckily we had a Kai.，A 5.9-rated Lan Ling Wang is truly hilarious.，Apart from Kai, the other three teammates in this match are all reportable.，Someone even paid tribute to me
