Finally got to play Li Yuanfang，Early game details, come to steal the red buff，The enemy didn't take the red buff，Just learn skill 2 and go，Some people here said。

Isn't using Skill 2 for jungling too slow?，No problem，It's fine to jungle slowly，If I speed up, wouldn't I have to go gank?，This Sun Shangxiang is completely inhuman。

The red buff is still alive，he died first，If you jungle slowly, you can keep jungling forever，It's been 2 minutes since the game started，I'm still here farming jungle monsters。

The score is 4:1, looks like they can win without me，It seems like，I can still win anyway，But I still have to go take a look，I don't have to gank。

but I have to pretend to go for a gank，Otherwise, what if my teammates start slacking off?，must give teammates some motivation，Let him carry me. How is that Kunkun over there still alive?，It's a piece of cake。

The jungler must jungle，A jungler just needs to know how to jungle，And as long as you don't lose buffs, you'll outperform 90% of junglers，This is also a piece of cake.，This Sun Shangxiang is just a pure jungle creep。

Just walk away, don't fight Kai，Otherwise, the comprehensive rating would be too high.，It's great that Kai is attacking my teammates in the bottom lane.，Hurry to his red buff zone，I must protect my three jungle areas。

Just activate the ultimate skill directly，Anyway I'm not fighting anyone，This Li Yuanfang is so fast at PVE，This Kai actually knows I'm stealing his buff，even knows to trade buffs with me。

Seems like another expert，Indeed a master，and even has full mastery，They're invading my jungle，Attack him directly。

Li Yuanfang (the hero)，Not only is this hero unconventional，His rating is also absurd.，as long as we don't get kills but assists，actually doesn't give many points。

For specifics, you can refer to the current situation where Lanling Wang is coming to slay the dragon.，this match's Xi Shi，Actually, he's also a skilled player，Every time the minion wave arrives，He immediately rushed to provide support.。

This is giving the jungle minion waves to the jungler，What a pro，But actually, there's no need to give it to me, I'm letting the lane go，He gave me several waves of minion farm，I only ate this wave。

I was jungling in the previous waves，I'm busy right now，This wave is because the enemy mid laner is absent，can come over to take down the tower，a piece of cake。

The mage will let the minion wave push, which isn't actually a good sign，Jungling is already exhausting enough for me，also come to clear minion waves，The difficulty of operation is too high.，Moreover, he can even perform advanced maneuvers like lane abandonment.。

It means he might still be a veteran player.，If he really is a prison player, I'm done for.，This Kai is getting desperate，He immediately activates his ultimate as soon as he sees me now.，I'm just treating your jungle as my own and farming it, that's all。

Why so stingy，Come over and take the Lord next，Finally can afford the Imperial Seal and farm it once，directly reach max attack power，No need to farm anymore。

Since the mid lane kept giving me the lane，So I pushed straight to the high ground，Look at this Kai，panicked，Xi Shi got ganked。

Although I could save her this time，But I think the Tyrant is more important，If I don't take the Tyrant，Wouldn't this Xi Shi's death be in vain then?，Look look, he's using his ultimate again。

Using ult is useless，Let's see if we can take down the Lord，This Kai actually knows to ambush near the dragon pit，Go straight for his red buff，This is considered smart among Kai players.。

If it were another jungler, he would have actually been successful in ambushing.，Ah，There he goes activating his ultimate again, look how impatient he is，The Shadow Lord, invincible.，no lifesteal runes。

I did my best，Never expected the Tyrant to be this powerful，From the start until now，I've taken all the dragons，The enemy Kai didn't get a single dragon。

He might not even be able to secure the red or blue buff.，This Kai is ulting again，He really wants to kill me, you can tell.，Protect our marksman，This is a loyal player, let him have the kill.。

Now I've even entered the first-level bounty status，Looks like I've farmed too much gold，Shut down，Uh，Let's take this down。

Xi Shi is trying so hard，let him escape，I can't ease my conscience，Tried my best, just waiting to die now，Fortunately, it's，Li Yuanfang even with just one kill and seven assists，It's not a big deal，It's only 5 points, the combat power won't even increase.
