视频字幕：

start by stealing the enemy's red buff，Then just stand here and go AFK，move around every now and then，to avoid being taken over by the system，No points will be deducted even if taken over。

As long as I don't get kicked out, it's fine.，just afraid that the AI might boost my rating too high，Just stand still in the grass for three or four minutes like this，there's no problem at all，It works fine below Star level.。

Someone might say here，What about the King rank? Haven't tried it.，You can give it a try，What's the point of standing here doing nothing?，Actually waiting here for the red buff to respawn。

Take down the red buff as soon as it respawns，Camp at the red buff spawn point，Don't worry even if the enemy jungler comes，Just spin around with him when he comes，I've done my best, Lo Bai bumped into the wall。

Old Bai crashed into the wall，Lao Bai, the distance of the first dash is different from the second one.，Looks like I'll need to find a different hiding spot next time. I didn't even buy the jungle knife.，Because buying the jungler's knife would reduce the damage I take from jungle monsters，This way you can't feed the jungle monsters.。

Buy a pair of boots and then a Glowing Wand，Here some viewers might ask，Won't buying this get me judged as malicious itemization and kicked out of the match?，kicked out of the match，Don't worry, no one understands trolling builds better than I do.。

No one understands unconventional builds better than me.，Haven't you seen someone instantly swapping from Stasis to Revival Armor and then to Hourglass?，Of course there's no problem buying such survival equipment，Similarly, mages can also buy the Guardian Angel in the past.，I just want to survive。

What did I do wrong，I must survive no matter what，I see everyone says this equipment is good，What's wrong with me buying one too，I'm just a little noob。

can't even recognize all the equipment，I just bought it because others said it was good to use，The benevolent judge will surely let me off the hook.，Actually, it's also fine not to buy survival equipment.，You buy one piece。

You will definitely not be kicked out of the match.，I often see those mages building lifesteal blades，there's nothing wrong，I still say the same thing，cannot be reported。

I'll learn from him, he messes around with his equipment，playing like that and，can be in the same rank as you，proves that his playstyle is actually the right one，This thing is really good。

Getting hit also grants a speed boost，Indeed a good thing，No wonder so many people buy it，Look at this basic attack that also deals 12 magic damage，This is another mechanism in Honor of Kings.。

as long as you equip magic items，Your basic attacks will deal additional magic damage.，Good stuff，Now even my imprisoned Bai can deal magic damage.，My dear Bai has also become a mage now，Look, even when I play Lancelot I can deal magic damage!，This Lan was still filled in as a substitute
