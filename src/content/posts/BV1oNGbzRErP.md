Brothers，I discovered a really interesting rating，Wasn't there a rating called 'damage to minions under tower' in the previous video，called damage dealt to minions inside the tower?，After testing。

this score for dealing damage to minions under the tower，not attacking minions under the enemy tower，it's about attacking the minions in our own tower，This is probably meant to encourage us to defend the tower.，Watch my moves。

We shouldn't lane against him in the early game，Because all this fighting results in ineffective damage output and meaningless pressure absorption，No points for fighting，might as well AFK and do something else，We'll just wait here。

Wait for the minions to enter the tower before attacking，There's actually a risk in playing this way，For example, the tower will lose health，but it's fine，The tower is not Me。

The tower belongs to all of us, this Meng Tian really wants to attack me，But my Arthur comes with Overlord's Mail，is destiny，He cannot defeat Me，Destiny is on my side。

I'll just clear the minions under the tower，How dare you, a Meng Tian, think you can tower dive and kill me?，How dare you, Meng Tian, collude with Ake to ambush me!，I did my best，Nine people ganging up on me alone。

Luckily I managed to counter-kill one.，Meng Tian tears down towers so fast.，Now the first tower is gone，ran to the second tower here，I just want to clear minions under the tower honestly.。

This Montian has nothing better to do，Why do you keep trying to hit me?，Do you understand that we're both just dealing meaningless damage to each other?，Now my Sunfire Cape and little suspenders are ready，Can go over to leech assists now。

Although it only counts kills now，but it's okay，I cleared a lot of minions under the tower this game.，This Mengtian has already pushed me back to the high ground，Fortunately, my teammates came to support me.。

Otherwise, our high ground would have been lost very quickly.，After fighting for so long, I haven't even seen the enemy's first tower.，The tiny bit of health left on this top lane tower was actually taken down by Sun Shangxiang for me.，I don't know what's wrong with this Meng Tian，Right after dying, he spams '666'。

Anyone would think he's playing the 'chicken claw' strategy.，with a 0-5 score，relying on the suspenders and the little red face cloak，I also managed to snag over a dozen assists，Although there were only two kills。

and died three times，But I cleared a lot of minions，I contributed greatly to defending our towers this game，Fortunately, the shooter survived this final team fight，directly ace them。

Even after flashing, this primitive Meng Tian couldn't escape.，played the entire game，This is the first tower I've seen，still the high ground，also earned a silver medal。

This lane performance directly upgraded to a gold medal，I have no idea how this score was calculated.，100% damage taken during laning phase，I intentionally lured the minions under my tower to attack them，The system judged that I was under pressure.，Combat performance is garbage-tier，because combat performance is determined by kill counts
