Why is Li Xin building a support item?，Some people must be confused，This is called being a real man who knows when to yield and when to stand firm.，Our support isn't buying the blessing item this game，Is there really such a good thing。

If he won't buy the support item, then I will，Ah，There are three benefits，First, this thing makes you run really fast，It's very useful。

Secondly, this way when I go to clear the minion wave, all the gold goes to my teammates.，Me's economy score can be lowered，Third, boosting teammates' economy higher，teammates can then become the imprisoned players，There's one detail to pay attention to。

you just can't upgrade the Winged Spear，Upgrading to the Shadow Cloak would render all previous efforts useless.，Come kill the dragon when you have nothing better to do.，It's great to have the support item here，This money is also counted towards him.。

A follower mentioned he plays the 'chicken claw' strategy，What should he do if his teammates always pick Li Yuanfang to screw him over?，Are you stupid，You already know your teammate is going to play Li Yuanfang，Why don't you just ban him?。

Although I said normally I'd ban Da Qiao，but I also ban Yao and Li Yuanfang，I'm just afraid my teammates would pick her. If they play Loli and do nothing，riding on my head，I'm just a split pusher。

Then I go feed, getting a double kill for them.，So when I feel something is off，This Yao obviously isn't human，I'll just ban Yao，As for Li Yuanfang。

That's pure hero discrimination，I don't care if you can play it or not，seeing a teammate preselect Li Yuanfang，just ban it directly，let him play Li Yuanfang here。

the enemy might push to our high ground in just 4 minutes，So if you think your teammate absolutely can't play this hero，then just ban him，Here someone might ask，What if he starts slacking off then?。

What's going on here，Why isn't Luban moving?，How strange，This Luban and Sun Ce both stopped moving at the same time，What's going on。

Did both bots lag at the same time?，Going back to the previous topic，If he starts slacking off，He was already playing poorly.，Then it makes no difference whether he slacks off or not。

Whatever he wants，What if he's the only dedicated player on your team，started slacking off，Prisoners slacking off deserve extra punishment，The canyon stands on the side of justice。

Honor of Kings, the impartial judge will never let you get away with this.，Moreover, if a trapped player is using heroes like Yao or Li Yuanfang，Then it seems like this round is also doomed for you.，Enemy has been，I can tell this match is already lost with these teammates.。

I, a Li Xin with a support gem, actually ended up having the highest economy，All three enemies in the bottom lane's jungle have died again.，See if we can sneak in and take the high ground.，Mi Laidi is right here，Just drive them away。

No need to kill him，Oh no, he flashed back，I can't believe it，Was this Flash skill perhaps using that auto-targeting function?，Now the 1-1 score is still too good-looking。

I've already sold the support item now，This way I probably won't be identified as a support anymore，Damn, I actually got a 7.6 rating，surpassing 50% of Li Xin players，I'm going to pay tribute to my teammates
