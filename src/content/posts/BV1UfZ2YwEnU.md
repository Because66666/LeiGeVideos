Came across two marketing accounts claiming my Shadow Spear build for Arthur can farm gold medals，every game is a gold medal，What the hell gold medal，I've already said that thing is for lowering ratings，The playstyle is similar to chicken claw strategy。

The title already explains this is an unorthodox build，Why bother chasing gold medals when you've already got the Frost Lance?，Ah，It's about pushing towers, come try out this new version of Thorn Mail，and also taking the opportunity to play this fill-style account。

I found that I still can't directly go for the new Thorn Mail，should first get a Crimson Agate，Otherwise, the lane-clearing speed is just too slow.，The first match was a complete free ride to victory，Probably because I haven't logged into this account for too long.。

given welfare match，The other two lanes were completely dominant，The jungler kept ganking my lane, which also gave us an advantage.，As for the damage of this new Thorn Armor, I don't feel it's particularly high.，But the added tenacity from this new Thorn Mail is quite useful.。

Request backup，I can't feel any significant damage from the Thorn Armor，Probably because this match is going too smoothly，The enemy attacks don't even make me bleed，nor could it reflect much damage。

economically disadvantaged，won a game by being carried，The next match indeed came at a cost，Score 1:14, 6 minutes，7,000 gold behind, with only one kill。

It was still me who solo-killed the opponent.，rewriting history，Liu Bang and Han Xin together couldn't defeat Xiang Yu，rampage ah，This Dian Wei is just like he's turned on invincibility mode。

No one dare to fight him at all，Our team has no MVP，If it counts, I should be the MVP，Ah，Entering the third game。

the familiar win-one-lose-one pattern，found a dedicated player to carry us，This Annie is utterly inhuman，How could they even steal the blue buff from the carry player?，However, the 'prisoner' player always has a very good temper.。

nor did they give up，After all, hardcore players should be quite accustomed to such situations.，long accustomed to it，The persistent player also managed to tie the score.，The shooter being a 'prison player' is just different。

Not only knows how to follow me for tower dives，also knows how to push towers，Never really noticed，So Yuan Ge was dead，Will this icon above the head keep showing?。

One last thing，Many followers in the comment section asked why this jungle score is low，What's the deal with that low jungle rating?，I have a little tip to improve your jungle rating，Almost every hero has a last-hit score。

which means landing the last hit on minions，Some junglers are too thin-skinned，feel embarrassed to last-hit minions, or clear the wave without securing the kills，but failed to last hit，so the score is low。

The last-hit score accounts for a relatively large proportion in most junglers' ratings.，It's probably to encourage junglers to lane more and farm those last-hit points.，and also incidentally boost the economy score，The last-hit score typically requires around 40 to 50 minions per game.
