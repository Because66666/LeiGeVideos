视频字幕：

Start by invading the enemy red buff，the enemy team is taking the red buff，What should I do，Just let him take it，Anyway, he can't see me。

but I can see the red buff，almost there，A lifetime without a rival，Tried my best but didn't get it，But it's okay。

The opponent is Li Bai，He can't kill me，A level 2 Li Bai with red buff can't beat me at all，let him go，otherwise, it would incur karma。

Li Bai actually came to gank our Sun Ce，reduced our Sun Ce to just 50% health，while Li Bai only lost 95% of his health，I'm coming to help，I'm not coming to help you。

Others might think we don't even have a jungler on our team.，give the kill to him，This Li Bai always likes to run to the bottom lane，Just kill him outright，Because I'm about to invade his blue buff area.。

Now I need to guard Me four jungle areas，put yourself in his shoes，even if I were playing Li Bai，I can also protect my three jungle areas，because I've been jungling without ganking。

There's plenty of time to counter-jungle，The enemy's red buff has always been Me.，Actually, it's not a big deal even if the enemy jungler comes，A mere Sima Yi can't even defeat my Li Bai.，Don't be afraid, so what if he saw it?。

There's also a gap between cavemen，The hero Sima Yi can be really unpredictable at times.，I thought he had already run away，ready to give it my all and let him off the hook，Yet he was still right there。

Look how terrifying this is，Started the game by stealing the enemy's red buff，and reduced the enemy Akai to a sliver of health，let him go，The enemy Akai is still regenerating health at the fountain。

coming back to steal the blue buff again，This game, we picked Lan for the development lane，just in time to hand over our jungle to him，I'm practically living in the enemy's jungle now，Some viewers here might ask。

Why does the enemy jungler only play caveman heroes?，Because my overall rating is too low，as mentioned before，can only match against Lan, Dian Wei, Monkey King, and Kai，And in recent games。

I just straight up ban Lan or Dian Wei，then the enemy jungler has no chance to play，can only try to play those primitive heroes, right?，To put it another way, without Dian Wei or Lan, even if they pick Monkey King or Kai, I can still easily handle them.，Actually, banning Dian Wei has another advantage。

Because Dian Wei will always occupy a substitution slot，We banned Dian Wei，we can have one more hero in the substitute slots，That Li Yuanfang guy can actually be picked as a substitute，just like Lancelot, a complete waste of money。

waste my gold coins，I shouldn't have bought it in the first place，Li Bai is still too slow at jungling.，It takes forever to kill the dragon, might as well play the Birdman.，The Birdman can also infinitely dash through walls to mess with the bots.。

As you can see, the AI in Honor of Kings is quite intelligent.，By the way，Since these bots have wallhacks，sometimes he doesn't even bother pretending，as soon as you start attacking the dragon，he will come immediately，But I'm just circling around here with the Birdman，There's nothing he can do about me
