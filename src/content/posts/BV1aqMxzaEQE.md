This is the current win rate，This match is against a Flash-using Arthur again，Why are there so many max proficiency Flash Arthurs?，Someone asked whether to lower the activity level，This should probably be suppressed。

For example, this alt account of mine，play only 1 to 2 matches a day，sometimes play 4 to 5 matches，but if I play too many games that day，I won't log into this secondary account the next day.。

to play another alternate account，because there are too many alternate accounts，Each account can only play one or two matches，If each account were to play more than a dozen matches，I'd be exhausted every day。

As for whether there is any impact under the same device，I think this also has an impact.，So I used five different emulators for my five alternate accounts，directly simulated five different device models，and used virtual positioning to locate in 5 cities。

There's no choice, Honor of Kings is just too ruthless.，don't play tricks，All the effort I put into raising my alternate accounts has gone to waste.，Although they're all mass-produced，But that was also painstakingly achieved by me.。

Why are there so many Flash Arthurs in this King tier?，Who on earth taught this，As for accounts under the same ID but in different regions，That's definitely problematic，It's simply like one prison giving birth to two prisons。

endless generations，Back when the Chicken Claw strat wasn't popular last year，Accounts under the same ID but in different regions were unaffected.，but after the Claw Strat became popular，directly indiscriminately targeting accounts under the same ID but in different regions。

I have 3 such accounts，It's really exhausting，No matter how you play, it's always a 50-50 chance.，Not even pretending anymore，It directly matches you based on the most problematic account in your profile.。

My teammates helped distract Arthur away，Come to steal his tower，At that time, I still refused to believe it，So I switched to another server and created a new account，They didn't even bother pretending。

In the Bronze tier, Ma Chao and Jing appeared，Sigh，In the Bronze tier, I was beaten by him until my win rate dropped to only 50%，The matchmaking is painfully slow.，Every match takes several minutes to wait.。

As for different accounts on the same device having an impact，but the impact isn't as significant as it is across different regions，Usually, the first few matches are losing streaks.，then it returned to a winning streak，the account I use for testing。

70% win rate，This Arthur went home with low HP，But he didn't notice another wave of minions was coming，Wait a second, I'll just take down his tower directly.，So you've been marked as a hardcore player by this game。

That's really frustrating，The device you're using is most likely akin to a haunted house,，tainted with bad luck，bad feng shui，Arthur is coming to gank me。

Go straight to push the mid lane，If he dares to follow，I'll go destroy his high ground，Anyway, he can't outrun me，Arthur also died in the team fight.。

You might think it's troublesome for me to manage multiple accounts every day，Actually, it's not troublesome at all，Because when I play this game, the screen often goes black.，Usually when the screen goes black, I switch to play on other alt accounts.，This directly hard pushed the tower.，A fully-equipped Li Xin fears no turret.，In the end, I even picked up a kill, what a bummer.
