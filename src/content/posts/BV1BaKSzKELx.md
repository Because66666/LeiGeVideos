The jungler is countering the red buff，Hurry over and take a look，Xiang Yu is still clearing the minion wave，This can't be right，Why do both junglers not have Smite?。

Is no one going to take this red buff?，Hurry over and help out，Getting an assist is just an assist anyway.，Protect our jungler，Oh no, the jungler is down.。

I have to die too，Hold off on using the second skill for now, pay attention to the details later，Double kill，Just now, Miyamoto has died.，Maybe they're spectating me.。

He used all his skills before dying，He has nothing to say either，These past couple days to upgrade my technique，I've been searching for a hero that can team fight but still has an extremely low rating.，Initially, I thought of Zhang Fei。

because his crappy second skill deals no damage，can also shield teammates，Unfortunately, Zhang Fei has been buffed.，Previously, Zhang Fei's second skill added a shield，was still calculated based on Zhang Fei's attack power。

Now it's been changed to health，Otherwise, I could justifiably build physical attack items.，To further lower the rating，I went to the shop and bought a bunch of random stuff，for example, a Zhang Fei that can't heal, buying the Phoenix Eye。

only use the second skill to shield teammates，not using the ultimate, first skill, or basic attacks，Buying the sword shield is also useless，Finally bought another broken Guardian Angel，Although there are only 5 pieces of equipment here。

but only using the second skill，without using basic attacks or other skills，simply can't save up that much money，You might not even be able to afford a broken Guardian Armor，Even if it really comes to that, you can still buy a Blade of the Despair as a backup.。

During the first game playing as Zhang Fei, I really didn't get any assists.，and even achieved a good score of 2.2，By the second round, I realized something was wrong，I really underestimated this damned second skill of Zhang Fei，He actually managed to get assists.。

At first I thought it was the issue with the Aegis，sold the Aegis，He still managed to get assists，In the end, it made me score a high 4.6.，This harmless-looking no-damage。

Why did this seemingly harmless first skill manage to get an assist?，The jungler came to gank for me，immediately transformed，I watched his moves，This jungler is absolutely terrible。

Going to save him would raise my rating, and that would be a huge loss.，except for prison players，None of them are worth saving，Miyamoto Musashi is now 0-4.，The current score is 7:7。

Looks like another master of chicken-claw tactics，Went to steal but got caught，Did my best，This Miyamoto Musashi is about to go 0-6-0，feeds even faster than me。

But our marksman has already pushed to the high ground，This matchmaking system is just too perfect.，Although the other three teammates were completely useless，but it will always refresh the strong prison players，Our team got a total of 10 kills this round。

All 10 kills were made by the marksman and support.，Annie is also completely unstoppable，The first item built was Magic Resistance Cloak，After such a long time，Miyamoto Musashi finally got his first kill.。

still fighting against Xiang Yu，The Xiang Yu laning against me has finally died，This Xiang Yu isn't even joining team fights，We really couldn't have taken down his tower if he hadn't died.，Xi Shi is currently in the top lane。

So I just went ahead and took down their mid lane，The remaining two high grounds seem like a piece of cake to take down.，Ah，Xi Shi will definitely clear the minion wave in a moment，But I don't need minions to demolish the turret.。

Your team，The score is now evenly matched，perfectly balanced，but I've already taken down all of their defense towers，Enemy，Double kill，30 seconds
