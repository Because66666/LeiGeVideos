Last night my 10-game winning streak was broken，I tried my best，Our teammate players were too terrible.，couldn't carry me，All the losses were because the teammates were too noob.。

everyone is one strong player carrying four noobs，Why can others carry the game but you can't?，That must be because you're trash，Others don't complain about their teammates being bad，Why do you complain about your teammates being bad。

It must be because you're terrible too，If you had practiced hard, wouldn't you be able to carry me now?，It's all because our so-called 'hardcore players' refuse to improve their skills，got beaten up by the noob opponents，complaining about teammates being bad。

that's just complaining about the environment，Complaining about the environment means lacking skill.，Many people say this season uses the MMR system，This MMR system is just fantastic，one carry dragging four deadweights。

as long as you're not the one carrying the dead weight，The experience skyrocketed，What happened，just got killed，went to watch videos。

The enemy team got wiped out as soon as I respawned.，Many people in the comments want to know what this playstyle of mine is，The strategy is to stubbornly hold the offlane, and push their tower as soon as they leave.，But what if the enemy jungler comes to gank me?，The enemy jungler and mid laner come to gank me。

Then wouldn't my teammates be safe?，The entire enemy team comes to gank me，I switched to Lightform and held my ground under the tower，until our trapped players farm up，the enemy is done for。

What if the enemy doesn't target me in the offlane，What if they go after our marksman?，Hey，He's not coming，Then I'll just go take the dragon on my lane and be done with it.。

The goblins in this game are so annoying.，screaming all day long here，Then there's the frequently asked question about equipment.，Why buy Executioner，People have been asking about this thing since last year.。

Of course because it's cheap，Do you think equipment is free?，If I had the money, I would've bought six Blade of the Ruined Kings long ago.，I would have bought six Dominations long ago，Let's take a look at other equipment options at the same 1,800 gold price point.。

The Lightning Dagger doesn't provide physical attack, and its passive can't damage towers.，and it's easy to accidentally get assists，It's essentially just a plain equipment with only 35% attack speed.，a complete waste of money，Now let's look at another Vampiric Blade。

Heroes who desperately need this can just uninstall the game.，This life is over.，Please voluntarily join the Blood Demon Sect，In this case，Is the cost-effectiveness of Sanction maxed out?。

It has attack speed and physical attack，This is exactly what's needed for pushing towers.，The current score is 0-6，each one feeds once，But I fed twice, still leading my teammate by one kill。

to motivate teammates to redeem themselves through shame，This is called fighting with one's back to the river.，I'm definitely going to die this time，3 minutes 0-3，I did my best。

The effective time for assists is 10 seconds.，which means within 10 seconds after I dealt damage to him，He was killed by my teammate.，I didn't get the assist，A stylish solo kill
