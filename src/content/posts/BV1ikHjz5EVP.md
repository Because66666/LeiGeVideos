the pick rate of Pan Gu and tower-pushing heroes，The probability of being banned is getting higher and higher，The more I play, the more something feels off，Previously, bans were based on frequently used heroes.，I have an account that frequently plays Luban and Hou Yi in the gold lane.。

resulting in both Luban and Houyi being banned，In the new season now, it seems that the banning mechanism is based on in-game behavior analysis.，High tower pushing rate leads to targeted bans on tower-pushing heroes，they specifically ban tower-pushing heroes，Even though I don't play those heroes, they are frequently banned。

he also frequently gets banned，Now Mi Laydi and Li Xin are permanently stuck on the ban list, unable to come down.，The pick rate of Pan Gu is as high as 100%，as long as it's not banned，then someone is bound to pick it。

If there were no manipulation，No one would believe it if I told you.，The appearance rate of Pan Gu is absolutely abnormal，Probably matching me with players who frequently use Pan Gu，or it might directly deploy AI players。

under normal circumstances，You barely see Pan Gu a few times in an entire season.，Seeing it every day these days，Every match has one. The Jews actually developed customized matches.，based on different in-game behaviors。

then assign different customized matches，There are certain details to pay attention to when taking them for a morning jog.，just don't use the second skill or basic attacks to hit them，otherwise you'll get combat score，Try to avoid hitting enemies with the first skill as well.。

as long as the damage output stays between 0% and 10%，the score won't be high anyway，Moreover, the designers also mentioned in the Live that，Neither of the two can kill each other during the laning phase，Such actions contribute nothing to the team.。

Such unproductive actions are naturally to be eliminated，except for supports，You can lower your output score by not attacking enemies.，Supports don't have damage points，As long as you don't attack enemy heroes, there will be no output percentage.。

Pan Gu isn't chasing me，I'm heading straight to destroy his second tower.，Now the developers have added a bunch of random scoring metrics，you go to split push and last-hit minions，It's difficult to lower the economy score and tower pushing score。

but you can suppress the damage output score，I simply refrain from attacking enemies. In the past, I would leave them at low health and spare them, but now I don't even engage at all.，Now I don't even fight at all，I just run away after clearing the minion wave and roam around with max movement speed，After chasing for a while, they gave up when they couldn't catch up.。

I can continue to come over and destroy his tower，Hey，Ignore this Xiao Qiao, attacking people is wrong.，Killing is even more wrong.，The hero Cheng Yaojin is as fun to play as Arthur。

It's so strong.，Cheng Yaojin's ultimate ability is actually stronger than the Summoner Skill Sprint，provides additional healing effects compared to Sprint，Arthur is just trash，The ultimate skill isn't as good as Execute.。

Replace Arthur's ultimate with an execute effect，Arthur's strength would immediately improve，Can refresh and deal true damage，The Monkey King is split-pushing in the bottom lane.，I'm split pushing in the top lane。

even if I die，The Monkey King can also steal the Crystal.，The attack speed is still too slow.，more than running，You have been slain
