视频字幕：

This shows our veteran player is a tiger.，He failed to counter the buff at the start.，Then a buff was activated.，We can still fight back.，Looks like he’s a pro.。

As for who the veteran player on the other side is, it doesn’t matter now.，My alt account is already Rank One Starlight.，The enemy Luba’s build is still Electro Blade and Bloodsucker.，If they win, it would be a miracle.，The tiger’s record is about the same as mine。

but his score definitely isn’t as high as mine，The records are pretty similar，But what about team contributions? You just invaded their jungle，killed a few dragons and caught a few people，I was wearing the Crimson Lotus Cloak。

which inflicted the Grievous Wound Buff on everyone on the enemy team，The tiger even accidentally died once，Ah, so his score is naturally only nine points，The enemy Mi Le Di has Teleport.，At the start, she directly flies to our turret.。

She’s definitely going to invade and take our Blue Buff.，I’ve seen this video before too.，Your plan has been figured out.，Sure enough, she’s here.，Our jungler is also on the way.。

But in this match, our experienced player is Da Qiao.，And the support is also an experienced player.，It’s time to just give up.，Can’t handle it anymore.，But I’ve already earned the gold medal.。

Losing won’t cost me any stars.，As my rank keeps climbing,，the opponents get tougher and tougher.，Look, this guy was just laughing and joking with me a second ago,，seemed to be in a good mood,。

and now he’s even giving me a back rub.，It's only been two and a half minutes.，And he's already been driven mad by his teammates.，Sigh, their Marksman,，is only slightly better because his first item is a Bloodthirster.。

The first item should be a Bloodthirster.，It's really strange.，Clearly, his rank has improved,，but the players he encounters have gotten worse.，Look at the enemy team's composition.。

Xiahou Dun, Cai Wenji, and Bai Qi，Our marksman should get the Bloodthirsty Blade here，This match in Star Platinum is really strange，The opponents don’t seem human，But neither do our teammates。

Sometimes watching my teammates play is just frustrating，Of course, the most annoying are the substitute heroes，They’re all like cavemen，Playing Lianpo can’t beat the experienced players on the other side，I'll have to bring out Wu Yan, this quirky hero.。

Although this hero is quite quirky,，the damage output is pretty high, though.，You have slain，it's still possible to take on experienced players.，Don't look for trouble.。

And she can push towers pretty quickly too.，Killing spree，I see someone asking about Mi Yue in the substitute heroes list,，why not play her?，Mi Yue isn't a primitive hero either,，but the issue is,，you're asking me to use Mi Yue to take down experienced players in late-game team fights,，isn't that a bit too challenging?
