Perhaps the overall rating is too low now，Now I can only encounter Dian Wei and Lan.，I can't even encounter Monkey King or Kai anymore，After all, Monkey King and Kai still require too much skill to operate.，These players picking Dian Wei and Lan are clearly honest folks at first glance.。

Sometimes you even encounter a jungler on the opposite team with a fragile ego，just stole his red buff，He just went AFK，He just stood there，as if I were the one at fault。

The reference material has been forgotten，The ultimate ability has not been upgraded yet，When the enemy team sends a whole squad to gank me like this，I've already secured the advantage，They can't farm anymore。

even if they manage to kill me，they've already lost two waves of minions，The lost gold simply can't be recovered，Not to mention they can't even kill me，like the opposing marksman。

he's already done for，As long as I keep my health low，the enemy will lose their minds and come to gank me，Look at me casually strolling around the map，My level is just slightly higher than his.。

Just wandered around with them for 4 minutes like this，The score is 5:1, a huge advantage，It's clearly already a win，Look at their marksman, after all this time they're only level 4，I'm already level 5 just by wandering around here。

Now all three lanes on our side are completely dominating.，This Xiang Yu is already level 7, trying his best，Now, I actually don't even bother with these small jungle creeps.，The enemy jungler doesn't care about these，Just securing the red and blue buffs is enough to tilt the enemy jungler effectively.。

Second, if you idle around farming these small jungle camps，it's easy to inflate the economy score，Otherwise, you might accidentally end up with a high score of around three points.，This is not what I want to see.，I saw someone in the comment section say they have a 40-plus comprehensive score。

learn how to lose points like me，I already told you，This is only playable with a comprehensive score in the 20s，Your rating is so high，Are you trying to go pro?。

I told you long ago，You went astray in practicing the techniques on your own，Don't blame me, rogue cultivators are prone to qi deviation anyway.，Practicing half-baked techniques can also easily lead to qi deviation，You're a self-taught rogue cultivator。

practice half-baked techniques，It's already good enough if you don't intentionally lose.，Then someone asked，Can you play with a 30+ overall rating?，Around 30 should be fine too。

Because I've seen the comments, as well as the messages sent to me by those accounts with a comprehensive rating in the 30s，The enemy jungler you matched with is still using Dian Wei, Lan, Monkey King, and Kai.，Encountering these four basically means it's a completely inhuman match.，playing over a dozen consecutive matches，The enemies and teammates all pick those mechanically simple heroes。

Not a single mechanically skilled hero, which shows the account has been cultivated this way，like the players I get matched with，The ban picks are really weird，secured another small winning streak
