Yesterday's Hou Yi gameplay was very worthy of study，Let me try a game too，Starting the game without purchasing any equipment，start attacking with basic attacks as soon as you reach the lane，I've played exceptionally well this round。

Because I usually can't be bothered to upgrade my skills，Anyway, I just go online and spam basic attacks while taking hits，What's the point of me leveling up skills anyway?，And I finally understand why this guy Hou Yi keeps getting nerfed，Ah。

Because in these utterly inhuman matches，Hou Yi's strength is still relatively high，He could even defeat some marksmen without buying any equipment.，The time comes to 1 minute and 30 seconds，I finally saved up 700 gold and bought a pair of boots。

Then came an unusually long power gap period，saving up for Shadow Tomahawk，As you can see, Hou Yi's damage output is still remarkably high.，The opposing Garrow is 3-0，And I only bought a pair of boots。

saving up the money，He actually couldn't out-auto me，Of course, I can only bully these two - Huang Zhong and Galio.，Other marksmen would have killed me long ago.，I can even zone the enemy under their tower without buying any equipment.。

Hou Yi is just ridiculously overpowered.，This Galoro still won't leave，Sigh，Tried my best but didn't land the killing blow，Didn't land the last hit。

Shut down，It took me 5 minutes and 30 seconds just to afford the Shadow War Axe，Now starts saving up for the next piece of equipment，Tried my best but got caught by the monkey.，It's fine for immobile heroes like Houyi。

It's perfectly reasonable to die a lot，also successfully took down the opponent's second tower，Your team，Look, in this inhuman match,，Isn't this Hou Yi's strength surprisingly high?。

Not buying any items and randomly upgrading skills, yet still managing to trade blows evenly.，Double kill，But basically, it all relies on the ultimate skill.，The ultimate ability deals surprisingly high damage.，Teammates initiated surrender。

found that we're missing a teammate，someone went AFK，You must never surrender at this moment，Because in Honor of Kings, the AFK mechanism works like this，If a teammate goes AFK, the system won't issue you a protection card.。

only when the teammate is kicked out，only then will the system issue you a Protection Card，The most annoying part of this mechanism is when your teammate goes AFK，You have to wait for a while before he gets kicked out of the match，The system won't immediately give you a protection card as soon as a teammate goes AFK。

Look, now the system has given me a protection card.，Based on my observation，to get the system to issue you a protection card，Your teammate's AFK time must exceed 6 minutes.，As you can see, our team's Siming。

went AFK just 5 minutes into the game，He's just idling at the fountain now，Even after I revived, he still didn't move，Ah，That's why I say this mechanism is disgusting。

because your teammate on this side went AFK，You probably won't last six minutes，which means you won't last long enough for the system to issue you a loss-prevention card，surrender unanimously after receiving the protection card，Guess what everyone。

Why did I use this losing match as material，The correct answer is except for this match，I won them all，even in this lost match, the system still gave me a protection card，not a single point was deducted。

Honor of Kings is indeed the most fun game in the world，The more you want to win，the more you can't win，The less human-like you play，the more likely you are to win，Rulebook of the Canyon Article One，Never let Honor of Kings realize you're a real human
