Some say the game designers are going to modify the matchmaking system，Brother Lei, your chicken claw strategy is doomed，What do you think? Here's what I think，Didn't the planners say the same thing last year?，Isn't this just the annual must-watch show of Honor of Kings, the poetry recital?。

They just recite the script every year and call it a day—you don't actually believe they'll change, do you?，The producer says there are 10 players in a single match.，Then let me ask you, are there really 10 players?，The designer claims they don't manipulate everyone's win rate，while claiming there are issues with the matchmaking system that need fixing。

Then let me ask you，Since there's no issue with the matchmaking mechanism，He doesn't manipulate win rates，Then why did they modify the matchmaking mechanism，Isn't this self-contradictory?。

The planners also claimed they never made any changes.，So are they going to change it or not?，the Sun Quan's wife incident，The planners immediately groveled，deleted Sun Quan's wife Bulianshi。

Is this something a normal human being would do?，some hardcore players dedicated to underpowered characters，pleasantly talking to the game designer，Our character is just too weak，literally unplayable。

Please, when will the developers buff this character?，Look at the attitude of the game designer，Who? Never heard of，You haven't even tipped me 1 million，Why should I care about you。

The planners hate competitive players like you the most.，never thinking about spending money all day long，just thinking about how to improve their skills，no matter how much you improve your skills，planners won't get a raise either。

the game's revenue won't increase either，And competitive players are the most troublesome，then they want to nerf that，Wouldn't it be better to just quietly keep spending money?，Take a wild guess。

The new matchmaking system seems to categorize players into hierarchical tiers，a portion of players not restricted by the matchmaking system rely solely on skill，some are ruthlessly restricted by the matchmaking system，only a thirty to forty percent win rate，The last group of players benefits from the system, winning even while AFK.。

engage in differential treatment，This way players can't unite，won't collectively stop spending，then hire a bunch of trolls to say，The new matchmaking system is really super fun!。

Over time, the hardcore players will start to reflect on themselves，how is everyone ranking up，only I haven't ranked up，Am I just too bad at playing?，Looking at my 80 overall rating with only a 30-40% win rate。

start reflecting on where to improve myself，This Dorya support is just too good，I played like absolute trash，He actually managed to keep me alive，Normally I would be 0-3 by now。

At this point, I would already be 0-3，Not only am I alive and well，and even pressuring two opponents，This match still has some naturally gifted players，I'm only 0-3 now。

There's a player on our team with a score of 15-7，Feeding once per minute, even faster than me.，Someone just happened to ask this question，There's someone in the team who feeds faster than me，Should I compete with him。

who actually feeds more，In this case, it depends on whether it's a guaranteed loss.，If it's a guaranteed loss，feeding slowly，you're the MVP。

if it's not a guaranteed loss，then there's no need to compete with him，After all, we essentially still want to win.，Some naturally gifted players simply have no intention of winning，You go compare yourself to him。

the grinders are doomed，Why is this Dollya following me and spamming retreat?，They still haven't given up on me，Seems like a good person，Finally managed to sneak into the high ground.。

The gifted player, he's already at 1-13.，However, our imprisoned player here still has a positive KDA.，It can be seen that the trapped player is truly formidable，Heaven is about to place a great responsibility on a person，must first toughen the mind。

harden one's muscles，destroyed too many turrets，I actually got a bounty at level one，reached max movement speed，It seems destiny is on my side. After 20 minutes of battle,。

I've finally destroyed all of the enemy's towers.，Your team，The Storm Lord has spawned.，I still have to come take a look at this team fight，I just picked up a kill here。

But it's no big deal，Anyway, skulls keep respawning frequently，Wang Zhaojun, you damn prisoner player dare to troll me，You dare to troll me, you veteran player，feeding faster than me，The Jews will never let you go
