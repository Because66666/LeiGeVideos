This match became much easier to play after banning Daji.，because some stubborn players，He likes to play those primitive characters，If we can't push early on，later on he'll just get one-shot by Daji's combo。

Without hardcore players, who would pull this cart，Just straight up ban Daji，Let them play as Xiaoqiao or Angela，at least the skills still require aiming，These noob players are still manageable。

Watch the details, here comes the play，This round we can't take down the enemy's Luban，but still need to drive him away，I've done my best，Let me say it again。

If jail players imitate me, it's like stepping into the path of demons，Me all tactics, except for virtue farming gold medal，Other imprisoned players can't use it，while grinding for virtue points medals too much，the outcome is inevitably a sub-50% win rate。

The score is 2:7 in the first two minutes.，As you can see, our teammates are still quite strong.，averaging one kill per minute，The jungler seems like a 'prisoner player'.，Alright, I'll go save him then.。

If he didn't look like a prison player，I wouldn't even bother with him，I accidentally picked up a kill just now，I thought Shaosiyuan had very high damage.，I never expected him to actually give the kill to me。

Actually, the support doesn't need to be this good，The King's Paradox，When you're playing absolutely terribly，your support will become exceptionally good，when you perform exceptionally well。

then your support will be utterly useless，Only one of you and your support can be considered human，To explain it using the 'chicken claw' strategy, it's because you're playing terribly，so your support becomes stronger，When you play exceptionally well。

your teammates are literally trash，So your support naturally becomes weaker，Low EQ, prison-bound player，You're done，Watch me match you with a bunch of repeat offenders and ex-convicts。

there's no escape for you，Let me see what kind of repeat offenders are around here，High emotional intelligence, currently matching you with opponents of comparable skill.，Please wait patiently，I've done my best。

Score 12:13，It seems we're at a disadvantage，Three people ganged up on me, I got caught，Can't escape，The score is 16:19。

We're at a huge disadvantage now，At this point, it's almost impossible to win without backdooring.，Here comes the crucial detail，Our teammates are team fighting，Must not go over and pretend not to see。

Oops, lagging.，I've done my best，Got caught again，But I don't want to die in this wave，The turret is still damaging our minions。

I can't fall yet，Only by taking him down can I feel at ease，Ah，After destroying it, just walk straight to my death，I've done my best。

The current score is 21:21，It seems both sides are evenly matched，Which side will ultimately win?，It's really hard to tell，But just from the current situation。

The blue team is still at a disadvantage.，After all, there are only three people in this team fight，while the opposing team has 4 players，The ADC on the blue team did their best but still fell.，Now the blue team is at an even greater disadvantage.。

Here comes the key move，Dong Huang is defending the base, let's use our ultimate to control him first.，Now we can demolish the tower without worries.，Nice，Team fight, watch。

I'm going to bait out Dong Huang's ultimate skill，My teammates said to take the dragon，Focus on the dragon fight，This Li Xin is a naturally gifted player，Li Xin using Light form equipment in Shadow form。

Honor of Kings has a bug，Why can't this dragon be killed，I've done my best，My teammates asked me to take down the dragon，didn't give me any other instructions。

Forget it, let's just fight here for now.，I'd better not mess with this dragon karma，almost done，Retreat，Not good, it's still Me。

Oh no, my teammates got wiped out at the dragon pit.，Whatever，Go straight for the crystal，All three enemies are in the dragon pit.，Although my teammates got wiped out。

But destroying the crystal is just a piece of cake for me.，Just kill this jungle monster as Annie.，If I hadn't fed him two kills，He's still 0-6 now.，The score is 28:30，The team was wiped out in a huge disadvantage，Luckily, I made a comeback from behind.
