Mid-lane chicken claw strategy, why not play Ying Zheng or Mi Leidi，How many times have I said it，Taking down towers isn't important，Can Lancelot demolish towers without minion waves?，Then why play him。

Do you really think I won，Is it because of backdooring?，It's just because the system matched me with good teammates.，otherwise how to steal，And the system has matched you with good teammates。

All you need to do is one thing，that is, as long as you don't drag him down, you can win，It's just that simple，The system will assign four deadweight players to the hardcore gamers，slow down his ranking progress。

And as the deadweight，as long as you don't drag him down，he can carry you to victory，Then you can appropriately lower your rating，Just let the system think you're always a burden.。

Can Mi Lay's minions even follow orders properly?，running around everywhere，What about my rating?，Pushing towers also earns points，Can Ying Zheng's crappy ultimate even clear minion waves?。

All attacks landed on the front line.，You should pick a fast wave clearer，whether it's Annie，or Jiang Ziya，Clear the minion wave early。

prevent your lane from falling behind，Just don't drag down the hardcore players.，Midlane is prone to team fights，two or three people at a time，If you don't choose a hero with AoE-clearing ultimate。

with AoE fast wave-clearing，Do you think Qin Shi Huang can cut off the minion wave?，As I mentioned before，You play jungle，as long as you don't give the opponent the red and blue buffs。

and also know how to slay dragons，can already surpass 90% of junglers，The same goes for other lanes.，My 9-year experience playing Honor of Kings，Your marksman knows how to push turrets。

the jungler knows how to secure the dragon，don't feed the buff，the mid laner can clear minion waves，The support doesn't roam randomly，Avoid overextending in the solo lane, and you'll outperform 90% of players.。

not seek merit，avoid mistakes，Leave the carrying to the hardcore players.，Mages must be able to clear minion waves，Otherwise, the enemy team will protect the minion wave with a group effort。

Without AoE damage, it's game over.，Yesterday I played 10 matches with a 100% win rate.，Played 7 more matches today and won them all.，The hardcore players of this game are driven crazy by the developers' constant tinkering every day.，you don't drag him down。

He would be more than grateful to you.，Although I go zero kills and several deaths every game，but my mid lane has a huge advantage，Look, we've already pushed to the high ground.，Naturally, no teammates would complain about me. The build goes like this.。

Universal for all mid-lane heroes，core equipment, Frost Staff and Golden Sword，Wand-Sword Style，Wander the world with a staff and sword，The Imperial Seal goes without saying。

Universal equipment for all heroes，My Jiang Ziya also uses the full penetration rune set.，I tried my best. This account wasn't originally for playing mages.，only with Penetration Runes，Actually, the full set of physical penetration runes isn't complete yet.。

only level 60 now，Anyway, I'll just focus on clearing minions，I'm not even fighting enemies，The damage is completely sufficient.，I did my best。

Score 15:26，the enemy has already pushed to our crystal，Looks like it's a real uphill battle.，Luckily, I'm best at making a comeback in adverse situations.，As a final note。

The Torment Mask can trigger effects on turrets.，but it's useless，might as well auto-attack one more time，15:4, three of the four kills were given by me，Three out of the four kills were fed by me.，Can't carry these five, they're doing their best，the opposing team of five，I've done my best
