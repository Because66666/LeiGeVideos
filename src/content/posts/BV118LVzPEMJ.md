This dead ant seems to be a pro in this match，I might just get carried.，It seems like every Dead Ant I've encountered hasn't been a noob.，After all, this hero is quite rare to begin with，probably those still playing are all pros。

This Li Xin is also a top player，is a top-tier off-laner，And you can tell from the name that this player frequently uses Li Xin.，directly build Thorn Mail as the first item，to prevent him from going on a rampage。

Having lower economy is actually a good thing，to avoid getting the MVP，Now my economy is the second lowest，Because I've been freeloading off my teammates the whole time，I haven't even touched the minion wave in the bottom lane.。

give all the gold to teammates，Then someone might ask here，What if teammates don't clear the minion waves?，Uh, what if I'm the only Lian Po among the four teammates who can clear minion waves?，This game is still doomed。

Now I'm already 2,000 gold behind my teammates，trying to suppress the economy score，see if it can be a bit lower，This Kagura is pretty good in this match，Every team fight I can keep up with them。

Although I have low economy，but I built the Thorn Mail, this Li Xin，he couldn't take me down，However, Haino's damage is still quite high.，I was still thinking about whether I should Flash-Flicker。

Li Xin flashed out first.，Marko Polo has been helping me clear the minion wave in the bottom lane the whole time.，He now has the highest economy，My teammates will clear the minion waves，Then I won't clear it。

I haven't been to the bottom lane in ages，I've spent 6 out of the 10 minutes in other lanes，Gather，No matter how we fight this round, it's always a close match，Ah。

It seems the Tiger Talisman is working its magic.，but the outcome is already decided，the enemy Luban Blood Demon Sect disciple，The enemy stands no chance now，The loyal yet often losing player Lan on the enemy team was brutally countered by the system.。

Although it's a close fight right now，but the opposing team has no chance of winning anymore，Our team is performing well，the opposing side only has a struggling Lan，In the previous video, someone asked about having veteran players carry newbies。

let veteran players carry the noobs，What if these loyal players quit the game?，The answer is, veteran players would never quit.，Loyal players will motivate themselves，Ugh! How come it's a ten-game losing streak?。

It must be because I played too poorly，I only got 16 kills this round.，If I had gotten 160 kills，Wouldn't we have won this game then?，Besides, even if a dedicated player really quits the game。

he will come back，because he has spent so much time honing his skills in this game，spent so much money，Even if he quits, he'll come back，or get called back by friends。

while those who play poorly，He won't delve into this game，He doesn't read game guides，don't study game strategies，He doesn't even read the game update announcements。

He genuinely won't come back after quitting the game.，Loyal players leave but always come back，Assuming the die-hard players truly quit the game，Is it one person quitting or nine people quitting，Can't the planners tell the difference?。

This Sima Yi is pretty impressive this round.，The timing of their engagement was pretty well executed.，Although the enemy's Lan is also pretty good，But this is not a one-man show，It's the glory of the team。

No, I think this damn ant is playing really well.，How come this dead ant only got an 8.6 rating?，The enemy Li Xin is also a pro player，Fortunately, I have the power of the Thorn Mail.，Come take a look at this damn ant, this damn ant is a classic。

It used to be the present，Now is the past，The rating has increased，The win rate has dropped even lower，Even more interesting。

The enemy team's tryhard Lancelot is so skilled，still got hard-countered by Luban，still a Honor of Kings player，take a look，This is even worse than before。

Now is the past，Even AFKing the whole match would give you a higher win rate than this，Killed over a dozen, but still couldn't turn the tide.，Although the stats can't be clicked on，but his stats have already told the whole story。

Thankfully, the fair judge severely balanced this Lan.，Otherwise I would have been in danger this round.，This Luban has lower economy than the support.，I wonder if I can report this，Others are expected to lose 4 points next time。

This one even only got 3 points，They can't even be bothered to make empty promises about the expected outcome.，Report this Lan，Honor of Kings is so much fun，Honor of Kings is the most fun game in the world，Lan is expected to lose 4 points next time
