Some followers reincarnate and create smurf accounts, ending up in Bronze-tier matches that feel like peak-rank games，full of smurfs，and they don't even get matched against veteran players on the other side，What's going on here，This clearly indicates the account has been flagged.。

At this point, the white knights are about to speak up，How could Honor of Kings go to such great lengths，to mark your account，Such a big company coming after you personally，People who say such things must have nothing useful at home。

Let me put it this way，even those Flash-based web games，it will tag accounts，You're telling me Honor of Kings doesn't tag accounts，This is not some high-tech stuff。

Isn't it just about adopting different strategies for different groups of people?，Moreover, this test was conducted last year with two accounts at the same rating，same rank same time，play the same lane for matching，one takes five to six minutes to match。

the other one gets matched instantly，Why is this happening，So hard to guess，Could it be that there were only 11 people playing Honor of Kings during that time period?，The first 10 players were matched together。

Was that person left out?，After another 5 minutes，The number of active players in Honor of Kings increased to 20 people，So the match was made，Some crappy accounts are simply unplayable。

It's like being the naturally untalented type in the cultivation world，Ten years of cultivation is not worth one year for others，In the context of the game，you grind for ten days but gain less rank than others achieve in just one day，Account tagging, to put it bluntly, is big data-based price discrimination.。

mark you as a prison-bound player，then relentlessly exploit the captive players，After all, loyal players are less likely to quit the game.，and even self-motivate，Why doesn't he target newbies。

Punish them and they'll quit the game，What's the point?，For example, as repeatedly shown in previous videos, players who perform poorly are expected to lose 3 points next time.，Expected to deduct 3 points next time，Veteran players are expected to lose 4 points next time。

Why is this the case?，So if you create a smurf account，find the difficulty level is still extremely high，it means this account is already ruined，The result of you continuing to play。

from Prisoner Player No.1 to Prisoner Player No.2，still trapped，Look at this account of mine, I've almost played a hundred matches，every game ends with zero kills，No points were deducted at all。

You're playing like this with a veteran's account，You must have intentionally thrown the match.，Respawn tutorial at the 50-second mark，It's almost 4 minutes.，All troops, assemble immediately。

Arthur has returned，Ignore him，This is a good thing，As long as I'm not killed by the tower，won't receive a warning if Arthur doesn't support his teammates。

I'm freezing the lane and watching videos here，Arthur went to support his teammates，I pushed straight to the second tower，This siege minion didn't make it in，Damn it。

No problem, taking down the tower without minions is still quick，So this Arthur and Kai are just camping in my off-lane, huh?，Can't push the offlane，went to the middle lane，Just as the Mid-lane's Daji also met her demise。

Team has destroyed turret，Sigh，Now is the time to show your loyalty.，Now we need the minions to tank.，If I take the hit, I'll die。

We can probably end the game now.，The enemy hasn't returned, Annie.，Go and instantly kill the enemy's Daji.，Not good, we've dragged it out until Arthur respawned.，Neither attacking early nor late。

Now I can't save you either，The enemy team is actually doing the dragon, come take a look，I tried my best，Burned a flash, not bad，They are clearing the minions, but actually missed a minion in the mid lane.。

Just lead this Kai towards our teammates and that's enough，I don't want to bear the bad reputation of killing Kai.，The enemy's return is already too late，That's all for today
