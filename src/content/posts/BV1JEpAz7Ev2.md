The official stance discourages supports from securing kills.，Therefore, the kill score for supports is extremely low.，This has been mentioned long ago，After all, the officials certainly wouldn't encourage supports to go for kills, as you can see，Although I have a positive KDA。

but the overall rating is still very low，because the kill score weight is too low，can be ignored，Now look at how many assists I get，So you must never take assists。

The proportion is larger than that of kill scores.，Last year, I saw a Follower in the comment section，got 25 kills with Jin Chan，but with zero assists, the rating was only seven or eight points，because his Jin Chan was classified as a support。

So, this hero's playstyle is the opposite of Lanling Wang's.，Lanling King can freely rack up assists，This thing can easily get kills，Let's see if this 'big boss' has any rebellious behavior，Come over and hit this goblin right in front of him。

He actually dares to come over，You have slain an enemy，Killing this goblin is also Me，Grace，This 'prison boss' immediately uses his ultimate as soon as he sees me。

What does that mean，Even if you use your ultimate, you still can't beat me，This useless ultimate skill is pointless，The damage is quite low.，not even as high as my basic attack damage。

Prison boss actually dares to ult，The damage is way too low，If I weren't out of mana，I immediately turned back to fight him，He fought for a long time。

didn't even manage to kill a single one of my clones，The enemy seems to be ignoring this 'Prison Boss'，a full 6 minutes，I didn't see anyone except the Prison Boss.，Alright。

Unstoppable，It's the best outcome that neither side sent anyone over.，No one is coming from the enemy team，I just need to take down Lao Da to destroy the turret，no one from our side comes。

I won't gain assists to increase my rating，Team has destroyed the turret，He's only level 7 now，Forget it, no need to wait for his ultimate to end，Go all out。

His basic attack damage isn't even as high as mine.，low on health and mana，Just find someone to help me regain some health，Shut down，At the 8-minute mark, we've already pushed to their high ground.。

The enemy 'Prison Boss' is completely useless now，He couldn't defeat me，went to attack my teammates，ended up being treated as minions by my teammates，I tried my best。

turret well，My teammates are destroying the crystal up there.，I'm taking down the high ground here，Now three accounts have reached the King rank.，The fourth account might be a bit challenging.，It's the one playing as the jungler.，Because the performance is too human-like，Consistently getting scores like 1-1 or 1-2, and ended up being labeled as the team's shining star.
