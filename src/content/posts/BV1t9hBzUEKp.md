This Harpy skin is actually a limited edition，How does it feel almost the same as a 6-dollar skin?，It even looks somewhat similar to the default skin.，This game I directly secured 4 buffs against Zhuge Liang，From the start till now, 4 red and blue buffs。

He didn't get a single one，I played 5 matches today，In one game, Li Yuanfang was picked by a teammate.，Li Yuanfang was banned，It's clear that Li Yuanfang is truly an overpowered hero.。

must-ban or must-pick，The birdman's shield is unexpectedly quite thick.，Many times I thought I was dead for sure，actually managed to survive，Probably because my first item was the Blade of the Despair.。

This shield of the birdman is 100% physical-based.，The enemy Miyamoto realized his red buff was gone，so he ran towards our side，Fortunately, Li Yuanfang's PvE speed is fast，immediately unleashed the ultimate to take down the red buff。

Look how stunned this Miyamoto is，Since he failed to counter-jungle our buff，so he went for a gank，Just in time, this blue buff is also Me.，The small jungle creep is just a bonus.。

With the sword, flying daggers, sigh.，Miyamoto Musashi is about to come back for the blue buff.，Now I'm going over to take their red buff，Guard Me's 4 jungle areas，Miyamoto Musashi really came to take the blue buff。

Then this red buff is mine，Both the red and blue buffs are gone，Musashi Miyamoto must be furious，came to steal my jungle monsters，Since you're here, might as well take care of it.。

If you dare to counter-jungle，You will surely suffer a crushing defeat.，Starting with 4 buffs，He only took one, yet dares to come fight me，Anyway, Li Yuanfang's rating system is just like Lan Lingwang's。

no matter how you fight the score won't go up，Killing him doesn't give many points either，Come at me and I'll treat you like a jungle creep，As soon as Miyamoto respawned，found the red buff gone。

so he ran to the blue buff area，Unfortunately, the blue buff has also been taken by me.，I've also taken down the Lancelot.，and took down the dragon as well，Wait, he sees the blue buff is gone。

just ran towards the dragon pit，found the dragon was also gone，Sigh，Although Li Yuanfang isn't great at PVP，but its PVE speed is truly impressive。

Even with the Primordial Bond, I can still slay the Lord，Musashi Miyamoto is still hiding in the bushes waiting for me，want to catch me in the act，So what if you saw me，That was me. You're lucky you ran fast.。

or else I would have farmed you like a little lizard，A level-7 Miyamoto Musashi is ambushing my level-10 Li Yuanfang，How interesting，This match is against Miyamoto Musashi again，You can see Miyamoto Musashi is ganking the top lane.。

So I can just go steal his blue buff in a moment，I love playing against Miyamoto Musashi the most，This hero has slow jungle clearing speed.，also slow in traversing the map，Did my best to spare him。

This mechanical puppet really doesn't know what's good for it，Just kill him directly，Details, stop the basic attacks，I'm going to take my blue buff.，Miyamoto Musashi。

He's still up in the top lane right now.，After taking his blue buff, I'll clear out his small jungle camps as well.，Anyway, I'm not ganking anyone，there's plenty of time，Miyamoto Musashi still hasn't come back。

Might as well clear out his red buff jungle while I'm at it.，This mechanical puppet is so ungrateful.，Every time I steal something, he's always there.，We must silence him permanently.，also got two ineffective assists。

Li Yuanfang's assists basically give no points，So what if Miyamoto Musashi saw it, come and take the Lord，Look how good this Li Yuanfang is，This efficiency is simply incredible，This is also Me。

And Li Yuanfang is also excellent at pushing towers. Watch this, at just 6 minutes.，All three bottom lane towers are still standing，It's still 6 minutes now，All three bottom lane towers are gone，I noticed this Miyamoto Musashi just loves spacing out。

the last game's Miyamoto Musashi，also stands motionless in certain situations，Since Miyamoto Musashi isn't moving，I'll just take out his jungle monsters then，I just wanted to steal their crystal。

This Eileen keeps stopping me repeatedly，I think he has a death wish，Hey, you have slain an enemy.，Nice killing，It's just been 11 minutes now。

All three top lane turrets of the enemy team are still standing，It's still only 11 minutes，All three towers on the enemy's top lane are gone.，It's too late to come back now，still 11 minutes，The enemy's crystal is also gone，Enemy unstoppable
