It's in the bag, everything's in the bag，Ranking God, Golden Badge Dian Wei，If I don't screw you over this game, I'd be letting down that golden badge of yours.，Ah，How could there be a golden-ranked master in such a barbaric land?。

That enemy Luban is simply inhuman，This is a berserk Luban，He immediately activates Frenzy as soon as you hit him，with full proficiency，Now it's even more stable。

I saw someone asking me，Why do competitive game designers hate competitive players the most，Let me give you an example to make it clear，You are a shop owner，There are two types of customers coming to your store。

One type of customer barges in and starts buying like crazy without a second thought，those stale old goods in your shop，those pieces of junk that even dogs wouldn't buy，he bought everything without hesitation，and you can even sell it to him at a higher price。

He even thinks he's making a profit, another type of customer，consulting you all day long，and give you suggestions，telling you how your store should be run，In short, it's just chatting with you。

not buying a single thing，Even if they do buy something, it's very little.，You chat with him for half a year，he might only make one or two purchases，still a cheap item。

then as the shop manager，Which type of customer do you prefer，Why did all my teammates come to my bottom lane for a team fight?，Originally, I was just having a clumsy duel with the enemy Lu Ban here，So many people coming。

I still need to be careful，otherwise I might accidentally get an assist，The teammates are finally gone，Take advantage of teammates being away to secretly feed a kill，This Sun Ce actually got an assist。

Didn't notice，This Luna is actually a pro，Looks like I need to keep you in check，Otherwise, I feel like our Dian Wei can't win.，We also took down the second turret at the 7-minute mark.。

It's mainly because of that enemy Luban，He's absolutely inhuman，is not just messing around in the mid lane，was invading Luna's jungle，Luna, you're done for。

It's not easy to pull off a highlight play.，This high ground is not easy to sneak attack，I've been ganked by Sun Ce three times already.，I've done my best，Now it's Sun Ce's turn to taste some bitterness.。

Help him out，Fall back，Never miss a shot，Did my ultimate hit 7 times in a row?，How would I know。

Why does this Sun Ce seem to have a grudge against me?，kept targeting me，I just wanted to sneak a turret，go to step on the vision spirit，Tried my best but couldn't destroy it。

Been slain，This Dian Wei only got 5 kills after fighting for so long，I've already fed 6 kills，General Dian, let's see who can feed more.，Just tank the tower directly。

My teammates will still help me push the turret.，Seems like everyone's a pro，There are two dragon minions in the top lane, just push straight through for the final assault.，It was also a hard-earned star.，Unstoppable
