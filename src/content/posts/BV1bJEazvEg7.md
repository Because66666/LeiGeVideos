Meng Tian's damage reduction is quite useful，and the basic attacks also restore health，In the early game, I actually out-damaged the Original Flow Child in auto-attacks.，But I can't kill him.，Just as our jungler finished taking the blue buff。

come over to my side，give the kill to our jungler to help him farm，The jungler is still a Glory Leader，Bad operation mistake，I should have died together with the Origin Stream Child.。

That way the Primordial Stream Child could be worth a few more bucks.，2 minutes and 10 seconds fountain exit tutorial，Jungler and mage, come help me gank the Origin Stream Child.，I don't even dare to take a look，Seeing them alive, I can't bear to see them die。

Hearing its cries makes me unable to eat its flesh，I dare not even take a single assist，All troops, form up and demolish it now，Although it's still the first 4 minutes，But Meng Tian's tower destruction speed is very fast。

If not now, when?，We won't be able to destroy it once he respawns.，Team has destroyed，Oops, I accidentally got another assist.，Just stay alive。

Suggest changing Meng Tian to be considered as minion damage，Not counted as Meng Tian's damage, but as jungle creep damage，Took down the second tower in 5 minutes，I often see people saying that chicken claw playstyle is about tricking teammates，is just a freeloading dog。

Then let me ask you, if we can be matched together，it shows that we are equally skilled，Since we are equally skilled，Then my win rate is higher than yours，Who is actually throwing the game。

Are you saying that I, with an 80% win rate,，Am I, with an 80% win rate, pretending to be a teammate compared to your 40% win rate?，You with a 40% win rate carrying me with an 80% win rate，Does this make sense?，To say the least。

The canyon stands on the side of justice.，Since you think I screwed you over，Then why don't you report it to the officials?，I'm afraid you're not on the side of justice at all，Even if you go to report it。

He will also tell you that I didn't violate any rules at all，I haven't lost a single point after playing so many matches.，I thought that's how the game was supposed to be played.，Fortunately made it back in time，The defense tower is also secured。

I'm really fed up with this Origin Stream Child，I've been playing this game for 9 years，Do you think I don't know what the reporting mechanism is like?，Those who play poorly cannot be penalized，That's just his skill level。

Players with low activity shouldn't be penalized either, it's reasonable for them to perform like this given their low match count.，Persistent players, penalize them severely，deduct like crazy，He clearly could carry all four teammates，but not utilizing their full potential。

Even the MVP can be judged as intentional defeat，The defense tower is almost down.，The interference cooldown isn't ready yet，Killing the dragon for no reason when bored，Fortunately, Meng Tian's hero rating is quite abstract.。

Killing one person doesn't give much rating either.，I regret it，I shouldn't have used my ultimate to attack the dragon just now，Otherwise I would have won straight away.，without four minions。

left all alone，The opponent missed a minion while clearing the lane.，Although this minion is now at low health，But as long as I charge ahead of the minion later, it'll be fine.，The enemy team is team fighting near the dragon pit。

The super minion is gone，This minion is actually still alive，All troops, assemble!，2 seconds to demolish
