Some people questioned whether this screenshot of mine was photoshopped，I can only say that spending half a day photoshopping is not as good as taking a screenshot in the game，Because even when photoshopping, you still need to follow some logic.，but the Jews just say whatever they dream，completely illogical。

This screenshot was taken from the promotion match of Starcrest I，Zhao Gao called a stag a horse and claimed he was a new player，then he is a new player，There are also Followers who told me that in the King-tier matches，the reporting system also labeled them as a beginner。

I have plenty of such screenshots，I can take out a few more，Zhong Kui can predict the umbrella's position，Huang Zhong exploits vision to deal high damage，Gongsun Li is no match for them。

It's clear that Gongsun Li tried her best，Nice，To show you these are two different people，not the same picture，I have blurred parts of their names。

Zhong Kui's divine power allows him to easily hook the mechanical puppet from a long distance，can easily land a Q on the puppet，The puppet cannot defeat him，Seeing this thing, Zhong Kui players are already laughing in frustration.，Is Zhong Kui's second skill really longer than Mozi's second skill in range?。

Does Mozi's second skill have a longer stiffness duration than Zhong Kui's second skill?，Look at this, Cai Wenji's first and third skills have massive healing，Skill 2 can hinder Arthur's pursuit，Anyway, I did my best，Not only could Arthur not defeat Cai Wenji。

Even Sun Shangxiang couldn't defeat her，You have been slain，Nezha can gain vision of the entire map，reveal the invisibility of Lancelot，Watch the score 5:22。

But I've already stolen most of the turrets.，Climbing ranks is so fast after being labeled as a noob by the system，The outcome was naturally secured, presence at the tower prevails.，Winning despite a 20-kill deficit，Now let's take a look at this match。

The score was 0-9 in the first 5 minutes，All three lanes plus the jungler are completely crushed，By the 8-minute mark, the score is 3:20，The score is 3 to 20，The enemy jungler is no fool and knows how to secure dragons.。

three kills，and one of the kills was mine，Teammates also wanted to surrender multiple times.，In the end, we took down the crystal in 13 minutes.，Finally, let me show you a naturally gifted player I encountered。

When he plays seriously, his overall rating is 55.，89% win rate，even higher than me，I only have 84，He is still a returning player，Click on the Home, it says 'Returning Player'，A returning player with innate talent, all buffs stacked
