Let me show you my KDA with Li Xin，averaging 0.9 kills per game，1.2 assists，I tried my best，Although the rating for each match is still 6.6。

but I also play Lancelot and Montanus，so it can still be suppressed，Han Xin is going to counter the blue buff，Just follow along directly，not only can help teammates。

and even skipped a minion wave for a great deal, their jungler actually dared to come over，Take him down directly，but the kill can't be Me，subtly letting allies take the kill，Li Xin got an assist。

The karma is too great，This play was directly thrown away, I tried my best，copy that，I'm currently 0-2, the score is 1:7，Which means some teammates are feeding even faster than me.。

There's no way I'm letting this happen，I'll go feed a kill too，If this is a losing game，If I die slowly, I'll be the MVP，If this is a favorable game。

feeding isn't a big deal，If this were an evenly matched game，No way, it's 1:8. How can you call that evenly matched?，The designers claim that our rank progression will be both fast and steady，However, the reality is。

He just wants you to aim for climbing ranks through hard work，to approach every game，doesn't actually want you to rank up，Just like your boss exploiting you，work hard to earn big money。

Is the key point making big money?，The key is to work hard，He just wants you to work hard for him with the goal of making big money.，But does he really want you to make big money?，He'd rather see you starve and be unable to leave。

this job，work for him for a lifetime，Not for a lifetime，you can leave when you're old and can't work anymore，Honor of Kings is no different。

Does he really want you to climb the ranks?，He would love to see you going up and down forever without making real progress.，keep grinding for him day after day，no time to play other games，All you do is play Honor of Kings all day long。

If you really made a fortune，would you still come to work，If you really managed to rank up，Would you still play Honor of Kings?，I feel like our jungler can't win。

Go over and help，No good, he really can't win.，The jungler has already fled，Then I'll run away too.，What is this。

Does he already know I'm here?，Oh no, it's the Glory Leader，Run quickly，I've simply optimized Li Xin's equipment setup，replace this Endless with the Imperial Jade Seal。

Focus on rolling for movement speed with the Imperial Seal's attributes，All other attributes are unnecessary，unless you can roll it，Physical attack +40，Because with Li Xin's speed boost activated, he still can't outrun others on flat ground.。

so you must prioritize movement speed，9-minute high ground push，Now we are gradually gaining the upper hand.，Luckily I was killed by someone，otherwise the Jews would warn me。

This is how Honor of Kings encourages us，Never feed the enemy by intentionally dying, especially not by turret diving.，Oops, I accidentally clicked the transformation button.，I destroyed most of the turrets in this match.，Directly pushing high ground without minions。

An enemy has，I tried my best and accidentally clicked the transformation again，new battlefield，Luckily, I managed to transform in time，Otherwise, I would have been slashed by the returning Xiang Yu.。

This transformation button is problematic，I don't think I clicked on him just now, did I?，Sun Quan, I really can't save you，I'm going to destroy the crystal now.，You're on your own.，No! My minions，Why are you two just standing there watching? It's you two who got him killed.，Luckily the super minion made it into the crystal.
