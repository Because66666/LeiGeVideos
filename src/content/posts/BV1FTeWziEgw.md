视频字幕：

Actually, it's quite easy to identify AI opponents in a match，But I can't teach you，First, the official team of Honor of Kings, Jews and Zhao Gao are all watching me.，If I teach you today, they'll patch it tomorrow.，it will be fixed tomorrow。

Secondly, teaching it is useless anyway，You know who's a real player and who's a bot，It makes no sense，because many real players perform even worse than AI，You target the real player on the opposing team。

beat that terrible real player into a negative KDA，turning their AI teammates into awakened AI，you'll be dumbfounded，Yin-Yang imbalance occurs，the enemy team will spawn powerful demons。

The actions of AI opponents follow discernible patterns.，they all follow predetermined commands，while some real players' actions are utterly incomprehensible，I've played the most outrageous match，There was one guy who played for almost 30 minutes。

only bought 5 pieces of equipment，Goodness gracious, are you trading equipment for profit here?，So sometimes the AI teammates in the match are actually the reliable players，while that real player is the actual noob，So identifying real players isn't very useful。

Just play the game as usual，Fortunately, I didn't get stuck with that Li Xin kill.，Someone also asked, what comprehensive score is needed to encounter a bot match，Of course, no matter what the overall rating is，He can still encounter bot matches。

Even with an 80 or 90 rating, you still end up in bot matches.，but the opponents are Awaken AI，you can't win, and your team happens to be low-level bots，you can't carry，The advantage of lowering your rating is。

the AI opponents on both sides are low-level bots，There won't be any awakened AI coming to smurf here，the matches will become much easier，The burden on struggling players will also be much lighter，29:29 It seems like a real close match.。

If I must say what's the use，then you can go all out，For example, in this match, I've already identified，this match except for me，the other 9 players are all AI。

In a match like this, naturally you can't lose no matter how you play.，and you can also feed to your heart's content，Because they're all AI bots，No matter how I play, no one will report me，Of course, there's no need to even pretend to perform.。

not even a single assist，straight up went 0-7-0，all are bots，No need to put on an act with real players anymore.，I tried my best but gave away 3 kills in 5 minutes。

feed three kills in 5 minutes，but the score is 7:7，As long as you play poorly enough，the system will help boost your rank，because they're counting on boosting your rank。

to troll skilled players，using AI to torment skilled players，Once spotted by veteran players, they will inevitably curse at the officials，but using unskilled players to torment trapped players，it will turn into mutual insults between players。

push the noobs up，not only can it trap skilled players，it can also retain unskilled players，kill two birds with one stone，The current state of hardcore Honor of Kings players。

winning — abnormal data — account suspension，Lose — Deliberate defeat — Still get banned，The Jews set up a cunning stratagem，Trapped players mistakenly enter the Penalty Zone，In my last match with Annie, I realized it was an all-AI game。

directly went 0-7-0，This playstyle isn't suitable for veteran players，Even in an all-AI match, hardcore players，he also has to play seriously，otherwise you could still be flagged for intentional defeat even if you win。

The prisoner player wants to rest，go to the Penalty Zone to rest，In this match, our imprisoned player Xiahou Dun has gone AFK.，But it's okay，even if the prisoner player goes AFK。

The Jews would also refine the imprisoned player's body into a puppet.，Xiahou Dun still gets MVP，without the imprisoned player，The system just fabricated one for me, 28:28. Seems like truly fair competition, huh?
