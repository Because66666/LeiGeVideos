Many people asked me to check out Hylos. After playing a few matches with this hero,，This hero seems only capable of lowering the rating.，play the chicken claw strategy，boost up，If you want to play the virtue farming style。

Wait for me to stack a few marks before team fighting，Stacking upwards is too difficult，but if you intentionally lower it，This hero's tower-pushing speed is just too slow.，The lane clearing speed is actually quite fast.。

The survivability is quite high，But since I'm already playing the chicken claw strategy，What do I need survivability for，What I want is to go down together with my teammate，Otherwise the rating can't be kept low。

How am I still alive，I thought I was dead for sure，The current new version of this Frost Staff is the same as the Frost Lance，His passive skill can now damage defensive towers.，So you can buy an Icebound Arrow to increase the tower-pushing speed.。

but it's still not much faster，even with the Frost Crystal equipped，Arcane Boots and Golden Staff，His tower-pushing speed is still very slow，Now my Ice Wand is ready。

You can see that attacking the turret deals multiple instances of damage，but it's still slower than minions. With any other hero, I would've finished it by now.，Damn, I didn't even take down the tower and I died.，Sigh，But this hero's rating is quite easy to suppress。

If you avoid team fights for the entire game，can achieve a score around 3.x，similar to when I play Bai Qi，My Bai Qi often ends up with a score around 3 as well.，This really proves that choice outweighs effort.。

Also feeding over ten kills，The fastest-feeding Xiang Yu gets the highest rating.，The advantage of playing Hylock with the 'chicken claw' strategy is that it's easy to suppress the rating.，Some veteran claw-style heroes are extremely difficult to keep their ratings low，such as Li Xin and Liu Shan。

They can easily score seven or eight points with casual play.，Although Hai Luo's rating is easy to suppress，but it feels extremely frustrating to play，The tower pushing speed is too slow.，And I'm not sure if it's just my gameplay issue，Why does playing this hero feel even more torturous than playing Meng Tian?，I never felt this powerless even when playing as Meng Tian.
