视频字幕：

Isn't my teammate already pushing their high ground?，Why doesn't he go defend his base?，stuck in a deadlock with me for 6 minutes，He actually rushed straight over，can't take a single hit。

Through a field of flowers without touching a single petal，Thankfully, I've encountered this situation quite often these days.，I'm using Meng Tian to hold the lane here，The enemy gets impatient and rushes over directly，If I fight him。

this kill will be mine，4 minutes later he was killed，his tower is naturally gone，Actually, there's another advantage to playing Meng Tian，This hero is particularly slow in providing support.。

For example, if you're playing Li Xin，your teammate comes to gank for you，in a 1V1 duel with the opponent，At this moment, if you just stand by and watch, doesn't your conscience bother you?，If you go help, you might easily get the MVP。

Meng Tian is different，This thing is ridiculously slow，Ah, tried my best，want to provide assistance，I can't catch up with the enemy。

I just slowly walked in defensive stance，Can't catch up with them, nothing I can do，Haha，And even if I catch up，I can still slowly charge up。

After charging for so long, it's bound to miss. I tried my best.，When hit, immediately move away from the minion wave，Even if I die，these minions can also go to push the tower，Anyway, my teammates are helping me gank。

I just stay there charging my power，I'll never strike unless fully charged，when I'm fully charged，the enemy had already escaped，I can't catch up if they run away。

A closed loop has formed，This Zhong Wuyan has been stubbornly fighting me this whole match，Ah，can't tear down his tower，I'll just come and take his dragon。

Anyway, my teammates are better than his teammates，I'm not in a hurry either，the moment it's time，He comes right on time to clear the minion wave，It's really annoying。

Looks like I'll have to use my life as bait to protect the minions and push the tower.，He's chasing me now，Luckily I have Swift Boots，It's clear that he really wants to kill me，Because I've been zoning him out for the first 6 minutes。

almost starved him to death，Right now, the dragon minion is attacking his tower，He must have gone back to clear the dragon minions.，So I also came here to clear the dragon，That makes perfect sense。

Then come over to clear the minion wave，Just leave directly，I knew he was waiting to ambush me here，Hmm，want to push his tower。

must kill him，or lure him away，Our jungler has been killed，That's great，The jungler got ganked。

which means I'm safe now，come to sneak a tower，Liu Shan is also pushing the high ground，They simply don't have time to deal with me，How come you're back so soon。

I almost took down the high ground as well，Just leave，Because the minion wave is coming now，as long as I can lure him away，My minions will naturally take down that high ground。

I can die，but my minions must survive，If I die here at the high ground，This minion won't survive either，Successfully took down the enemy's high ground。

then go take the dragon，Now 0-4，credited to Meng Tian's four minions，This great general hasn't died even once，It feels like we might be able to destroy the enemy's crystal.。

But there's a Sun Shangxiang here，Kai has gone back，Can't destroy it now，Oh no，Oh no, I still ran into Sun Shangxiang.。

Uh，This is a family matter between Liu Shan and Sun Shangxiang，This general prefers not to interfere，Has been slain，I just want to come and destroy the tower，Your team an ally，Has been slain
