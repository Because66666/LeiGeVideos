视频字幕：

Li Xin's damn transformation definitely has issues，transforms inexplicably，It's definitely not a misclick issue，Because my emulator doesn't even have skill hotkeys assigned，all rely on mouse clicks。

You can't even misclick if you wanted to.，Probably the Jews are flexing their power.，After all, Honor of Kings has a ton of mechanics.，Not to mention parallel universes，I think it's normal for time to flow backward。

Never mind this transformation skill，If he transforms automatically again，I'll just delete this key，teammates coming to support，I'll just recall directly。

to avoid getting an assist，can't tell，This Dian Wei is actually at full proficiency level.，I feel like even if this Kai doesn't come over, I could counter-kill him，I tried my best。

But in this round, I can't even kill them，I still have to die for a bit，This hero Li Xin is doomed if he gets a kill.，Our dragon minions are about to push the tower.，So we need to lure Xiahou Dun away。

Look, this Xiahou Dun still wants to go back and defend the tower.，But I immediately started attacking the buff to make him come back right away.，when his interests are compromised，He's definitely going to rush over to attack you，Just do it right in front of him。

Now the tower is down, and the buff has been stolen too.，The enemy team has a total of three kills，both were given by me，but I was the first to push the enemy's high ground，Let me be the first to ascend the city walls and claim the first merit。

An enemy has，Ignore this Xiahou Dun，Just dismantle it right in front of him.，Army attack，The two enemies died。

Two players are in the top lane, heading straight to destroy the crystal.，This assist from the Tiger and Leopard Cavalry was actually credited to me.，This trash skill, the Primordial Child doesn't even need to be managed，Not even comparable to Xiahou Dun，You can tell the jungler is coming to gank for me this time.。

So I just went up to trade blows with Lu Bu，sacrifice oneself for teammates' development，This half-health Lü Bu is definitely dead，An enemy has been，This is definitely a hardcore player。

This Xiao Qiao can also be taken down，Retreat now，Once this hardcore player farms up，Me days will be easier，Why is this opposing Lü Bu so dumb。

kept getting ganked，If this continues, my score won't stay low enough，Ah，Such a great scoreline of 0-1-3 is unplayable now，Ah。

This Lü Bu at level 5 actually dares to fight me at level 7，I can't believe him，Tried my best to let him go，I just love playing against smart players like Lü Bu.，brought him down to low health。

He knows to go back and heal，some people leave him critically wounded，He just keeps circling around the tower，leaving me completely helpless against him，Lu Bu has left。

But his defense tower is doomed，With the power of chicken claws，His wave-clearing speed is definitely slower than my tower-destroying speed.，Why are these two only level 6?，I feel like even if both of them attack together, they're still no match for me.。

There's that silly Lu Bu again，Go mess with him，Did my best but couldn't win，Lu Bu is too powerful，Now it's only 0-2。

The KDA is still too decent，took down the high ground in 6 minutes，still the first to reach the tower，I have to intentionally die in this wave，Otherwise the score really can't be lowered any further。

Don't use any skills, just wait to die，Fall back，Nice，I only went 0-5 and the enemy team actually surrendered，I should have fed more kills
