rotating through multiple lanes，Feels like an 80% win rate to reach King rank is achievable，The current win rate is still 82，is still considered relatively high，This Lu Bu is still a Glory Leader。

I can guess the reason for the high win rate，After all, you often don't play a particular lane，suddenly switch to that lane，In the system's eyes, you're just a complete noob who can't play at all.，must be a liability to the team。

And Honor of Kings' punishment for teammates who perform poorly is，penalize him by assigning him to veteran players，let him punish the hardcore players，And my overall ratings for all five lanes are below 60，No matter how you switch。

the system thinks I'm a noob，so of course it will match me with a bunch of noob players，In this game，as long as you're deemed a noob，ranking up will be much easier。

Cultivating with 5 spiritual roots is faster than with just one.，You stick to a single spiritual root, focusing on just one lane for too long，it often leads to your frequently used heroes being banned，But I keep switching between multiple roles，He simply can't ban them in time。

I'm playing as a marksman，He's still banning my Lixin and Lanling Wang，I've already switched to playing mage，He is still banning my Lu Ban the Seventh over there，The system simply can't keep up。

Moreover, I've also discovered that rotating through multiple lanes，The teammates and opponents matched are significantly less skilled than those encountered when sticking to a single lane.，the opponents encountered are more clueless，As you can see, the 5 spiritual roots are truly invincible among peers，The matched players are basically all AI bots。

or even worse than bots，after all, I haven't played that lane for so long，suddenly switching over, the system sees my last performance in this role，the overall rating is only forty or fifty，That must be a complete noob.。

The current score is 2:10，Look at this Lu Bu still chasing after me，I really don't want to kill him，let him go，Otherwise, he would die from my second skill.。

Although we are currently at a disadvantage in the score，but none of our defense towers have fallen，while the enemy has already been pushed back to their high ground, giving it their all，after fighting for so long，The enemy still hasn't destroyed a single tower。

Our tower lost just a bit of health，It was still the enemy minions that did it，No idea what the opponents are doing，Sometimes our entire team gets wiped out，The enemy is just spinning in place.。

They're even worse than bots，Lu Bu is AFK here.，Forget it, just kill this one directly.，Anyway, I'm Lancelot，No need for benevolence anymore。

Killing won't earn many points anyway，Since switching between multiple lanes frequently，The matches encountered are getting weirder and weirder.，Look at this match, our side is the winning team，and my rating was the highest in the entire match。

I actually wasn't judged as the MVP，It seems there are still performance requirements for MVP，The MVP system does not recognize 2.0.，But the MVP system recognizes someone with a 1-12 record.，This match was like this。

Because the people matched are becoming less and less human，wanted to lose but couldn't，After fighting for so long, it's still 0-0，Then when I was stealing the crystal，Someone actually came to stop me，I just used a few basic attacks to farm him like a jungle creep.，marched to victory with a minion in tow，judged me as a silver medal
