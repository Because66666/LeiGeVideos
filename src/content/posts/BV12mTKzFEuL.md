Because Li Xin's rating is too easy to farm，It has now become a hero that requires extremely high skill.，Just go play Lancelot instead，with slightly worse skills，Li Xin might accidentally end up with a 7.0 rating。

Moreover, playing as Li Xin gives you the feeling of being a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle.，when the enemy team is absolutely ruthless，I can't even fight back，Lanling Wang is much better，I can not only fight。

I can also help my teammates, and getting axed by the enemy Dian Wei，Great，not only died，also helped the team deal some damage，not a single kill and still died。

This way you won't trigger the bounty status，This is how the bounty system in this game works，consecutive kills, deaths, tower takedowns, or dragon slays，it will increase the bounty level，So it’s quite necessary to die occasionally。

As long as it's not consecutive, this bounty level won't increase，Dying isn't even worth much，just die casually，I'm doomed this round，Run further away。

This way he'll lose a few minions，Now the minions have entered the tower.，After respawning, Cao Cao came over again，Come help me out，Cao Cao can't reach it。

Then I'll take this kill.，Is the damage output of Cao Cao this high?，I thought I couldn't take down Dian Wei，This Dian Wei is built with full tank items，Cao Cao is such a nice guy。

After finishing the jungle, he came over to help me gank again.，lure this Kai over，Fortunately, I'm playing Lancelot this round.，If I were playing Li Xin here，He keeps ganking for me。

I can't even help him fight，I feel a little guilty，A follower asked if playing Li Yuanfang in the EXP lane is viable，Theoretically speaking, it's a viable strategy.，The second skill is untargetable and can even pass through walls.。

The first skill quickly destroys towers.，and even if you can't defeat the opponent，the opponent insists on fighting you，you can also use your ultimate to clear minions under the tower，The dragon clearing speed is also quite fast。

Of course, theory is just theory，actually if you pick this thing，your stubborn teammates are about to throw the game，jungle Li Yuanfang and marksman Li Yuanfang，Your teammates won't believe it。

let alone a Li Yuanfang in the off-lane，Li Yuanfang in the off lane is completely different from A'Gui in the off lane，A'Gu Duo is such an obscure pick.，Your teammates won't even know what this thing is when you pick it，Jungler? Marksman? Support? Off-laner?。

What on earth is this，But Li Yuanfang is different，This thing still has a decent pick rate，not that niche，Everyone knows this is a marksman。

Can your teammates trust you to play in the offlane?，So your playstyle can be unconventional，but it must be done before the game starts，gain the trust of your hardcore teammates on your side，Otherwise, your imprisoned teammates won't contribute。

Do you expect me to carry the game?，After fighting for so long, the strongest opponent is just a level-one bounty.，Ah，That Li Yuanfang, a level one bounty，I can't be bothered to fight him。

Hey，Don't touch this Kai，or else you'll get an assist，Although Lancelot fears no karma，but the lower the score, the better。

The lower the score, the better，After all, the canyon stands on the side of justice.，a higher score means no justice，you'll be punished by justice，The lower the score, the more righteous it is。

played for a long time，it's still that Level 1 bounty Li Yuanfang, with the highest bounty，Every time I open the panel to check who has the highest bounty here，it's this Li Yuanfang，I can't even be bothered to hit him。

A level 1 bounty is practically worthless，Look at this Li Yuanfang dying，I'm miles away and only got 20 coins，So poor，The moment I make a move, I'm guaranteed to take down at least a tier-three bounty.。

It seems I don't need to exert myself in this match.，playing against this level-one bounty and getting your own rating too high，What a waste, the opponent's stubborn player is Li Yuanfang，died，Stealing the crystal is just too easy，The skill is on cooldown，Lanling King's rating is just perfect
