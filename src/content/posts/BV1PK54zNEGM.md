This account alternates between one match of casual and one match of ranked，I don't know what's going on，intentionally feeding over a dozen times in casual matches，The next ranked match actually became a bit easier.，Not sure if it's an illusion。

It's also unclear whether the stars gained will be taken back.，Anyway, I've now achieved an 8-win streak.，This is my 7th consecutive win in a match，This match was also won.，Anyway it's just really strange。

Now I can encounter not only in matches but also particularly bizarre ones，I can encounter them in ranked matches as well，Moreover, there's no need to worry about being reported in match mode at all.，At first I was worried about losing stamina points，were all fed at a ratio of 1:6。

until I played the primitive Bai Qi，2-16 is fine，And Bai Qi's score is exceptionally low.，Other characters require exhausting efforts just to intentionally feed，The score could actually reach four or five points。

Bai Qi only needs to make a slight move to get a 3.9.，Just use the ultimate skill and rush to push the tower，Why does this Qin Shi Huang deal so much damage?，I did my best，Then play a ranked match。

I originally thought I was laning against Pangu in this match，But it turned out to be a Flash Monkey，This is a strategy from 30 seasons ago.，Isn't the Monkey King character just someone who couldn't survive in the off-lane?，then switched to jungle?。

It seems he can't even defeat my Li Xin，spare this Li Xin，We are all guardians of the Great Wall，Someone asked if anyone would scold you for playing like this，Of course not。

First, it's because we Honor of Kings players have high moral standards，Second, all the seasoned players have pretty good conduct.，have a great mentality as well，Here someone might ask，Why do all the veteran players have such good manners and mentality?。

Because players with poor mental states have already quit the game.，All toxic veteran players have been muted，Those who can still speak must be well-behaved.，Although our Honor of Kings reporting mechanism，Nothing can be reported successfully。

but cursing will definitely get reported successfully，not only deducts points but also imposes a mute，The whole team is feeding.，this poor player is barely holding on，In a completely one-sided match like this。

revival coins are infinitely distributed，There's no need to compete for kills at all，Li Bai's score is actually lower than mine，Now I can rest assured that I'm safe too
