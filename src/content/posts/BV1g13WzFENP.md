Actually, the 'Chicken Claw' strategy can be played in all 5 lanes.，So why choose to play as a jungler recently?，As you may have noticed，except for jungler，It's more difficult to suppress the ratings for the other four positions。

because they have to cover three lanes，you will inevitably encounter minion waves，If you last-hit minions, it will add to your creep score.，Seemingly coming to counter the Chicken Claw strategy，They're using all sorts of underhanded tricks.。

As mentioned before, this last-hit score，All heroes have this last-hit score.，Then if you play jungle and don't encounter minion waves, you won't have last-hit scores, right?，This last-hit score refers to landing the final blow on minions.，also known as last hitting。

counted in the lane performance category，Generally，You last-hit 50-60 minions in a game，can max out the minion kill score，achieve a gold medal。

The damn point is right here，If you're playing the Chicken Claw strategy and go to split push and backdoor，not joining team fights，then your minion kill score will definitely be maxed out，it becomes difficult to suppress the score。

At least 4 points，but if you don't last-hit minions，You can't even hold the tower in your own lane，So the advantage of playing as a jungler is that the jungler doesn't need to go to any lane，don't have your own turret to defend。

you don't have to worry about the minion waves，If you must manage the minion waves，remember not to last-hit，otherwise it will increase your score，This is probably specifically designed to trap veteran players.。

After all, truly unskilled players simply don't last-hit minions.，The economy is usually ranked fifth，Even when veteran players pretend to be noobs, they still have some muscle memory and routine maneuvers，it's hard to change all at once，Playing the Chicken Claw strategy and still ending up with the highest economy。

struggled all game to suppress the score，in the end, it still doesn't score as low as those naturally talented players，The solution to this problem is quite simple，that is, try not to last-hit minions，keep your economy at the bottom fifth。

once you last-hit a minion，not only does this include the last-hit score，and there's also the economy score，as long as your economy remains in fifth place，then your rating will definitely only be around 2-point-something。

Of course, there's another detail，you need to enable precision basic attacks，Otherwise, it's easy to kill the minions.，We just need to weaken the minions without killing them.，Then use precise basic attacks to target other minions。

did my best，It's fine to help teammates with the dragon，but you cannot be the one to kill the dragon，Got Hai Yue as a fill pick, and it worked pretty well.，without any runes。

Three first skills just managed to weaken the entire minion wave，not a single minion was taken，Of course, playing as the jungler is easier.，Playing mid lane also means I have to manage a lane's minion waves.，Junglers just need to focus on farming their own jungle camps.。

While heroes in the other three lanes are clearing minion waves，If you accidentally hit someone with a skill, it will count as an assist.，while junglers farm jungle camps in the jungle，There's no need to worry about accidentally getting assists at all.，the other three lanes if you don't clear the minion waves。

your tower is gone，If the jungle gets invaded，at worst, just give the jungle to the enemy，There is absolutely no loss，I would've gotten 2.1 long ago if I played Li Bai.
