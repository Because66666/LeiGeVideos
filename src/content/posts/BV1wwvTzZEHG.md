This account might have been played too inhumanly，Now it's impossible to match with real human players anymore.，You can see this Luban has a black proficiency level，The gameplay is utterly inhuman，Let's queue up another match to show you the intensity of the game。

This alternate account is used to test rotating through multiple roles.，Currently testing rotation between marksman, support, jungle, and off-lane roles.，Then someone might ask，Why no mage，Because the runes are all physical.。

As you can see, the people I'm laning against are all acting like complete idiots.，Currently this alternate account is at the Starcrest tier，Someone here said，I'll eat my hat if this rank is above Gold，Ah。

This is truly the Starry Glory rank，I finally managed to climb up here，Someone is definitely going to ask again here，Is the alternate-positioned Hou Yi a human player?，Those veteran players who started earlier all know。

Back when creating an account, the game didn't give you Hou Yi for free, it only gave you Arthur.，Tried my best, couldn't afford Hou Yi，Ah，Fortunately, the hero Hou Yi is permanently free to use.，So no need to buy, these 4 deadweights。

It doesn't matter whether you buy it or not，rotating through these different lanes，It's not very stable at the moment，This account has reached Star Glory rank，but my other account seems to be stuck in an endless cycle in Diamond tier。

Win two matches, lose one，Feels like it's going to be one win followed by one loss if I keep playing.，However, one thing is quite obvious，it's about switching between multiple lanes，The matched players are all particularly dumb。

whether it's teammates or opponents，It feels like none of them are human，Compared to other one-trick smurf accounts，accounts that play multiple lanes，The players I matched with can no longer be described as low-level bots。

It's simply artificial idiocy，I guess it's probably because I played multiple lanes, and none of them were real players.，It completely confused the system，Tried my best，Enemy。

The score is actually tied at 6:6，In a match like this, there's one detail，that is, you must never go AFK，because there isn't a single human on either side，once taken over by the AI。

the AI bots helped me secure multiple kills，Many times our side just couldn't win，made a teammate rage quit，Then that AFK teammate got possessed by bots and carried us.，claiming to be equal in skill level。

In reality, both sides couldn't withstand each other，Can we get some real evenly-matched opponents，I'm just stealing a tower，Why is the entire enemy team coming to the bottom lane?，Great, the Creator God Pangu has come to help me.。

How dare this Luban attack my high ground，Now I'm saved，Me teammates have all arrived.，How is it still alive，Come take a look。

Damn，I got the kill，No problem，Fortunately, I've farmed enough skulls.，Finally reached the high ground。

Watch me counterkill Luban in one go，then demolish the high ground，Not good enough, I tried my best.，teammates fighting，I focus on destroying towers while each does their part。

After fighting for a long time, only my bottom lane lost two towers.，huge advantage，Tried my best but couldn't defeat the minions，You can see both sides are still fighting quite fiercely，I also fought very hard，Finally reached the opponent's crystal，This really exhausted me.
