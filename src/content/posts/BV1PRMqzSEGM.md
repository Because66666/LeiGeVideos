I was wondering why I didn't get Lanling Wang in my fill position，So it was picked by the opponent，I tried my best but the opponent picked their hero faster than me，At first glance, they didn't even bother pretending to play fair.，I've never seen such an obvious guaranteed victory.。

Everyone on our team except me has skins.，Except for Lancelot, the enemy team is all using default skins，So who is the noob player on the enemy team?，It's really hard to guess，Entering the game, Hou Yi and Dong Huang engaged in a duel.。

Hou Yi couldn't out-auto-attack Dong Huang, then the support arrived，Both of them couldn't defeat Donghuang, in this kind of game if we don't feed there's no chance left.，a complete stomp，Tried my best. Yang Jian has been reworked and buffed.，It's reasonable for Li Xin to lose the fight。

but it's fine，Our revamp of Li Xin is extremely bold，so bold that they might not even have created a new folder，Now watch the details，If you can understand the move I'm about to make。

Achieving an 80% win rate to reach the King rank is a piece of cake for you.，If you don't understand, you can only be a prisoner player.，you can only be an old-school player，You must not get involved in any karma in this kind of match，Whoever takes the blame becomes the scapegoat。

who's the boss，Been slain，Han Xin not only stole the blue buff，and even farmed Yang Jian like a jungle creep，How to lose。

Got caught by Lancelot, that's great. This Yang Jian is so trash.，After fighting for so long, they still couldn't kill me，The Lanling King went to gank Luban.，Can they really catch our Luban?，Our jungler has also gone over。

The score is now 7:3，I was the one who gave away both kills.，The enemy Lanling King just respawned，took his blue buff，This Yang Jian is truly a master。

I never expected there would be such a move，Ah，This Han Xin won't retreat，Don't fight，It's over if we fight。

preferably zero damage output，This is a great opportunity to suppress the score，The time comes to 7 minutes，The score is almost tied now，The opposing team's prison-breaking player, Lanling Wang, started to show his strength.。

But it's not about being the king alone，but the glory of the team，Let him do whatever he wants，At the 10-minute mark，The score has now truly turned around。

Lanling Wang has entered the second-tier bounty state，has secured over a dozen kills alone，It seems that Orchid King is still struggling.，Even if you win this round, Lanling Wang，Judge Bao。

You won't be spared in the next game either，How could this Han Xin even lose to Doria，This Han Xin is also a naturally talented player.，building the Bloodsucker，Fortunately, I didn't help him at the start.。

I would have suffered a great loss if I had helped him.，Is it right for Luban to ambush Lancelot?，An enemy has been，From the 13-minute mark，The enemy just stubbornly holds the high ground and refuses to come out。

The teammates couldn't break through after trying for a long time.，can't even sneak in，because the enemy Hou Yi and Xiao Qiao were split pushing top and bottom lanes，one in the bottom lane，Even though I can beat him。

but I don't want to increase my rating，This kind of game actually dragged on until the appearance of the Storm Lord，This is so frustrating，The enemy is holding fast, and our team can't break through，Let's see if we can use the Storm Dragon to push for victory in one go.。

The previous minions were too squishy，can't get in at all，Our team still couldn't break through，Finally saw the opportunity，This siege minion got pushed out，Fortunately, another minion wave has come in.，After the fight, it turned out the opposing team's Orchid King was the team's MVP，That explains it.
