A prisoner player asked about their prisoner player account，Can I switch to playing the chicken feet strategy next season?，That's naturally out of the question，I've already told you, it's too late for regrets.，Regret comes too late。

Do you know what it means to grieve in vain?，too late for regrets，Now let's take a look at this AFK mechanism，When we remain inactive for a long time, we will enter the AFK state.，Based on my actual combat experience, it was found。

this triggered the AFK mode，Actually, it's because you haven't touched the screen for a long time，That is to say, if you turn on the auto-attack，let it fight on its own，then we drag the perspective to look at our teammates。

won't trigger the AFK system，because we're adjusting the camera view，Of course, it's not necessary to specifically look at teammates either，As long as you drag the minimap a little, you'll be fine，This auto-attack is quite smart.。

even knows to attack the wolf，The opponent directly surrendered.，To verify my point，Start another match，Now I'm letting him auto-attack jungle creeps here。

trigger this AFK auto-play，Then I just need to drag the mini-map a little to cancel it，See?，Dragging the minimap requires some serious skills.，So as long as we keep holding down the minimap, we won't go into AFK mode.。

So as for how long you need to be AFK to get kicked out，As mentioned before，You won't be kicked out until you've been AFK for a full 6 minutes.，your teammates will receive a point protection card，I also saw some Followers asking。

not buying a single item at the start，Will stalling for Guardian's Revival get you kicked out，That definitely won't happen，Think about those teammates you've encountered who were saving up for the Guardian Angel，Can you report him?。

Was he kicked out?，Now let's all guess，How long does malicious equipment selection refer to not buying equipment，The answer is 7 minutes，longer than AFK。

Going AFK for 6 minutes will trigger penalties，But you won't get penalized until you've gone 7 minutes without buying any equipment.，Through actual testing，From the start of the game until exactly 7 minutes，you haven't bought any equipment。

will trigger the alert for malicious equipment setup，Of course, as I mentioned，The reminder in this game serves merely as a notification，it won't deduct your credibility score，To put it simply, if you can buy the Guardian Angel before 7 minutes。

there wouldn't even be this warning for malicious equipment setup，even if this prompt appears, don't panic，You can go to the shop and buy some trash items，or quickly get the Guardian Angel out is also fine，Now you know why those teammates of yours who directly save up for big items。

can't be reported, right?，Because not buying equipment for 7 minutes is considered intentional bad itemization，even with my playstyle，I can even get the Guardian Angel in 6 minutes，The enemy surrendered again。

As for whether playing like this would screw over teammates，or being praised by teammates as the beacon of the team，Or will they get reported by teammates，that basically won't happen，A test was already conducted back in June last year.。

the comprehensive score is just over 20，They simply couldn't get matched with anyone，These people can't even pay tribute，He can't even find the report button，Even if my Mantis does nothing but jungle the whole game。

My teammates also achieved a massive advantage of 52:13，claim victory，to say the least，So what if he actually finds the report button?，The canyon stands on the side of justice。

The impartial judge will surely exonerate me.，This Zhong Wuyan is just too overpowered.，The jungle monsters can't break Zhong Wuyan's shield at all，Now there's no way to trigger the revival armor by attacking jungle monsters.，Someone also asked if playing this way would be boring。

That is indeed a bit boring，However, in Honor of Kings, I usually play with two accounts simultaneously.，The other account is still using Li Xin to backdoor.，When you're really bored, you can drag the view to check out your teammates，fighting jungle monsters for a long time without losing a single drop of blood。

Zhong Wuyan is just too overpowered.，Sometimes when I'm tired, I also come to play this account separately to relax.，playing Honor of Kings while reading novels，Life is so comfortable.，I can't play Zhong Wuyan anymore。

Although the skills don't have HP regeneration，but the passive is too overpowered，Even the Lord can't break my shield，You can't even die if you want to.
