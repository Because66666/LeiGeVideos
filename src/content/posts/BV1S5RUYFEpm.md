视频字幕：

The last video was actually wrong，Instead, all tanks no longer have damage taken score.，Warriors don't have it either，Previously, for example, heroes like Cao Cao who could both take and deal damage，Well, not exactly both tanky and high-damage。

Basically, characters with fast healing all have damage absorption points，Now Cao Cao is gone too，Not only is the damage taken score gone，I found that the damage score is also gone，which means now it only depends on your assists and kills。

Nothing else matters，how much damage you dealt，how much damage you've tanked is meaningless，You just need to find a way to secure kills.，except for supports。

It all depends on kills and team fight participation rate，Supports are evaluated based on assists plus teamfight participation rate.，Finally, the planner also mentioned during the Live，All heroes have economy scores，You just need to farm a bit more gold。

that guarantees a gold medal，So now instead of building tank items to absorb damage in the frontline，might as well focus on securing more kills，As long as you secure the top lane, you can achieve a meter reversal，you still gain one star even if you lose。

So in the new season, you absolutely must not play those kinds of，tank-only primitive heroes，even if you have 50% damage taken，your rating will also be a 3.0 carried noob，even if you want to play。

you should also bring Execute to secure a few kills，Otherwise your rating will definitely be between 6 to 8，Another advantage of going full damage build，You get no points with a full tank build，and can't even influence the outcome of the match。

Look at this match where Xiao Ming is paired with Gongsun Li, both with 0-2.，completely unplayable，But going full damage build can actually turn the tide of battle.，I don't know what's going on，Encountered three Gongsun Li today。

all paired with Xiao Ming，Every time it's just low-level bots, not even comparable to，At least low-level bots can assess team compositions，No matter how thick the health bar is, one slash will take you down，Alright, now it's time to start saving up for the Blade of Despair.。

My ultimate is almost ready，Both enemy carries are standing together，Directly dash over with the first skill and follow up with the ultimate，Eliminating both enemy carries is worth it，Double kill。

Playing Xiang Yu, I love bullying these immobile shooters.，Now the ultimate skill has been enhanced with super armor，The strength has been significantly improved.，Carried the game, almost got dragged down by this Gongsun Li again.，Every Gongsun Li I've encountered these days hasn't had a single positive KDA.
