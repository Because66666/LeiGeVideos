In the last video, someone was curious if this was really a provincial-ranked Dian Wei.，How is this possible?，This guy's Home page shows he's the 94th-ranked Dian Wei in Guangdong Province.，Now it's fallen into a paradox, you know，He's a provincial-ranked player。

couldn't possibly match with me，he can match with me，he couldn't possibly be a provincial-ranked player，Originally wanted to check who the No.94 Dian Wei player in Guangdong Province was，discovered he had hidden it。

But it's fine，definitely not him，Because he was left in the dust by my Houyi the entire game, with a 1k+ gold gap，This automaton support is really playing well this game.，Look how he's been leaving the lane for me。

holding the lane for me，Such a skilled support is truly extremely rare，What is this Bian Que doing，Why does he keep running towards me?，Tried my best but couldn't hit。

Hit the Automaton quickly!，Tried my best but didn't hit，Oh no, this is gonna make me look like a jerk.，had no choice but to take that kill，After all, the mechanical support played too well.。

Look, he's still keeping the lane controlled and leaving it for me，even when nearly beaten to death by minions, still refuses to take the lane farm，If I let Bian Que get away here，The machinist would definitely be pissed off，Can't let a good support feel disheartened。

Requesting backup，This machinist is actually pretty accurate.，When encountering such a great support, I feel bad about throwing the game.，He activated his second skill, so I'll use mine too.，I'll activate one too, slain initiates the attack。

This guy playing Bian Que is so clueless.，kept setting me up，made me end up with a 3-5 score，I'm really speechless，I've tried my best, but I'm probably done for now.。

An enemy，This guy is actually still alive，It's okay, there's still Lancelot.，This Lanling King actually ran right into my line of fire.，I can't believe it。

It's you again, Bian Que，You have slain an enemy，My teammates are too strong，The opponents are so dumb，I quickly distanced myself from my teammates and rushed to backdoor the tower.。

If I keep fighting, I'll end up as the MVP.，and grab a few more kills on the side，bring the rating down，This automaton hasn't missed a single shot, and it's already multiplied by ten.，With the Machine's skills。

It should be quite difficult to reach the King rank.，But Bian Que is much easier.，Someone asked me about Lu Ban's build，Ah，There are two sets of builds。

Just pick any build from the For You section，then don't equip any lifesteal items，replace the lifesteal equipment with the Hunter's Gloves，After all, if I really regain health and can't die, what should I do?，Ah。

The second build focuses on cooldown reduction，Rely on enhanced basic attacks to push towers，Equip the Sympathy rune，After all, I'm just such a merciful person.，I did my best. We are of the same origin,。

Why are we in such a hurry to fight each other?，This Lancelot only knows how to fight, me and Xiaoqiao，forced Xiao Qiao to buy both Guardian Armor and Twilight Armor, this Lancelot keeps farming，Both Xiao Qiao and I have reached the maximum bounty level.，However, Me has also accumulated 10 skull icons.。

Since the mage and marksman on our side kept getting ganked by the enemy Lanling King，making our veteran players struggle a bit.，The teammates in this match played really well.，I'd feel bad if they lost，Since the enemy team doesn't understand my chicken scratch。

then I know a thing or two about fighting，Going straight for the kill is also an option，Directly pushing to the enemy's crystal with a score of 6-10，Now I don't owe you anything，Enemy has been slain，Remember to wear sunscreen.，You scared me，Only 7.3 points, all three are trash
