Li Xin's rating is truly outrageous，This time I got teammates, all of them were good guys，I always prefer to stop at the right moment when laning against opponents，spare others，This match was seen by my teammates.。

I thought he was going to scold me，Then he said, 'Li Xin, don't be afraid'，You can beat him，Seems like a really nice guy indeed，The four teammates in this match were chatting quite harmoniously.。

I was too busy watching them chat，forgot to suppress the score，achieved a great 2-0 score，It's too late to feed now，because we've already pushed to the enemy's high ground。

Finally gave up one, did my best，Got a bronze medal with 2-1，This is so ridiculous，So I came over to test Li Xin's rating，I'm going to see just how ridiculous his score is。

First was a 1:1 kill，Your team has been，6-5 got a silver medal，then it was completely detached from cause and effect，with not a single kill or assist。

In the end, I secured victory with a score of 0-6.，The rating could even reach 5.7，A 4-3 score can earn you a bronze MVP medal，almost got the rating too high，Fortunately, I played one game as Li Xin and two games as Lan Ling Wang。

alternate between playing，Playing as Lancelot often results in scores around three or four points.，this way Li Xin's rating gets suppressed，Now there are minions in the top lane，The enemy Li Xin must be trying to steal our crystal.。

Recall immediately，Fortunately, I often do this kind of thing，Otherwise, he would have succeeded.，This Li Xin is still using a semi-tank build，The tower damage is simply not enough。

Just clear the minion wave and it's fine，destroyed, sigh，It's over，only 4-point-something，I use Lancelot as a score suppressant.。

If your score gets too high, just switch to playing Lanling Wang.，easily achieve a low score，the hero Lancelot，The rating is even more absurd than Montian's，Meng Tian wants to achieve such a low score。

have to be careful，the score accidentally exceeds 6 points，But Lan Ling Wang doesn't need to worry about such things，Here's a 4-6 KDA Lan Ling Wang with a 5.4 rating，Ah。

Now let's take a look at Meng Tian's performance，This is a 4-9 Montian，a 4-6 and a 4-9，a 4-9，Which one actually has the higher rating?。

Of course, it's Meng Tian who got the higher rating.，I thought Meng Tian's rating was already abstract enough，Having only 67 minion kills yet still being rated as Iron，Little did I expect that Lancelot is even more of a master，Some people must be wondering here。

Li Xin's rating is so high，those who play Li Xin normally，wouldn't that mean getting gold medals every game and ranking up effortlessly，That's definitely wishful thinking，The normal progression of the plot should be。

The first few matches did indeed earn gold medals.，and then it directly triggered，You're so good, why not carry me along?，Ah，His teammates are utterly useless，He was directly beaten by the opponents and forced into the 'chicken claw' playstyle.，0 kills and several deaths
