This game's Luban is a Glory Leader，and all three teammates have maxed out proficiency，All units attack，Luban still took Sprint，The first item appears to be a Vampire Dagger。

So hilarious，After clearing the minion wave, just return to the tower and stand there, going AFK.，I can't even be bothered to deal with the Pangolins.，You must never fight against Li Xin，because the game designers said。

This is intentionally building tank items，intentionally tanking damage，We must not intentionally take damage maliciously，After clearing the minion wave, just return to the tower and go AFK，Anyway, there's no points for fighting or not。

Might as well go back to AFK，It just so happens that I'm playing on an emulator.，doesn't affect me browsing my phone，You can even use the emulator to dual-window and play a smurf account on the side，The game designer said。

Except for team fights during the laning phase, whether you engage or not doesn't affect the score.，Then why should I fight him，So it seems it really is the Bloodsucker's Edge，Now waiting at ease for the 'prisoner'，waiting for our prison player to appear。

The chances of winning this round are pretty slim.，This prisoner must be Yao，If the noob player is Anila or Da Qiao，This game is still doomed.，The clock hits the 10-minute mark。

directly push down Li Xin's second tower，After clearing the minion wave, I just returned under the tower and went AFK，This made the Dark Li Xin so angry that he switched to Light Li Xin to attack me，Finally got caught and killed by my teammates.，He lost two towers immediately after dying once。

can't be bothered to fight him，Come check out the team fight，I can't believe it's really you，This noob player really is something, huh，This Tiger Talisman is also exerting its full power throughout。

This is also giving it all throughout，The score remained tied.，This guy Luban didn't build Vampiric Knife first，but Sever，but it's almost the same。

This Li Xin still wants to push Me tower，directly sucked out the minion wave，Now he's stunned，That Li Bai on the enemy team simply doesn't dare to fight me，only dares to hide in the corner and watch。

If it weren't for the fact that the Witch's Cloak only blocks magic damage，He can't even break the shield of the Witch's Cloak.，Anyway, with high HP，Just push the tower directly and start retreating，The opponents in this match aren't that strong either。

Basically, all the skills were thrown at me，also managed to take crucial damage in team fights, and surprisingly got a bronze medal，Turns out it's because I pushed lanes and destroyed towers too much，This Li Xin only earned 6,000 gold from lane clearing.，My Lian Po has over 7,000 gold from lane clearing.，Let's see what's going on with this Luban，Indeed a disciple of the Blood Demon Sect，The first item is normally the Vampire's Fang.
