In this match, my commonly used hero was banned.，Liu Shan was also picked by the opponent，Ban whatever you want，Go ahead and pick，Anyway, I play cavemen heroes every day。

You've banned all my caveman heroes，You'll behave when I play a Three-Body hero.，I've been playing these primitive heroes too much，The opponents only know how to play caveman heroes.，Look at the enemy heroes, they're basically the ones I frequently play。

Li Yuanfang has almost become a must-ban pick，as long as it's not banned，either I pick it or the opponent picks it，Got you, didn't I?，The enemy team is playing these primitive champions。

Whenever I decide to go all out，kill them easily，or else the opponents would switch to playing three-body heroes，It would be embarrassing if I go all out and still can't win，One minute into the game。

Our team just gifted them a kill with two deaths, retreating is absolutely out of the question.，local hideout，Now we're leading by one point.，I'm 0-3, looks like this match is in the bag.，and the ping is only in the teens。

The damage is really low，Should've taken the attack speed runes.，Three people demolishing towers is really fast，Although not as fast as five Meng Tians，But this speed is pretty decent.。

and the skill cooldowns are much faster than Meng Tian's，Took down the second tower in 6 minutes，It seems my teammates don't need me over there，I just need to focus on destroying the towers.，The delay in this match actually peaked at an astonishing 18。

It seems to be quite challenging，The highest latency I had in the previous three matches was only 16，The lowest latency can even drop to 10.，Looks like this fourth match is going to ramp up the difficulty for me.，Some people are curious。

determining if there are bots in the match based on ping，Will this method be fixed，It's very hard to fix，Because this is underlying code，The more bots there are, the lower his latency will be。

but they can tweak the displayed numbers，For example, you see some ads claiming 30 seconds，In reality, you watched for 45 seconds or even a full minute，The same goes for latency，showing fifty or sixty。

Actually, isn't 10ms delay enough?，Cyber ghost scales, the Jews would do anything to replace real players with bots，will do anything，Every merchant has a dash of rogue in him, that's the truth.，after initiating the attack。

There will definitely be more and more AI players in the future.，Replace disobedient and hard-to-control trapped players with bots，Wouldn't that be much easier to control?，This Dian Wei is completely inhuman now，He actually thought he could come and kill me。

I think this low-level AI is really overestimating itself，From the moment he used his ultimate on minions，I already knew his skill level，killing spree okay，Alright, the underlying code has been triggered。

Legendary double kill，This is actually a Star Glory I bot，Hey, not everyone in the world has weapons，3 out of 4 teams are all prison players，absolutely unbeatable
