Chicken Claw and Prison，Originally, according to the matchmaking mechanism of Honor of Kings，the trapped player will be matched with four teammates who are all terrible，But this poor player was incredibly lucky，matched with a 'chicken claw' style player。

He took the spot of a lousy player，and did everything from split pushing, backdooring towers, to controlling dragons，In the end, they even got bitten back by the furious and embarrassed player.，All the credit goes to the toxic player.，The 'chicken claw' playstyle became a freeloading dog.。

encountering such angry and resentful toxic players，he should be brought before the impartial judge，I just love laning against Sun Ce，Because when Sun Ce reaches level 4, he will definitely use his ultimate to support his teammates.，He went to support his teammates。

I can just demolish his turret.，What if this Sun Ce reaches level 4 but doesn't go to support his teammates?，What should I do?，It's fine if he plays Sun Ce and doesn't support his teammates.，His teammates are even more anxious than I am。

I've done my best. Li Yuanfang's passive is way too overpowered.，How does this Sun Ce still have his ultimate after supporting his teammates?，I really don't want to fight him，Just use the ultimate and run away，Our jungler is here。

Just help our jungler with some crowd control, let him take the kill，it's not a big deal to get it，At most, it's only 4 points anyway.，At first I thought this hero Lanling Wang could die five or six times，the score remains stable at around 5 or 6 and can't go any higher。

Later I realized I was overthinking it，Actually, dying two or three times already makes it very hard to raise your score.，Moreover, intentionally feeding with this hero，not to mention Judge Skyprison，even if there were 10 Eagle Eye Guards。

He couldn't even tell I was violating the rules，I'm going to feed the enemy，I specifically target the enemy's high-armor warriors. It's perfectly reasonable that my Lan Ling Wang can't defeat them.，Can you deduct my points?，I pressed all the buttons I could before dying。

I did my best，For example, when I go to assassinate the squishy targets，I initiated with my ultimate，Can you say I'm intentionally feeding and deduct my points for this?，You can only say I'm bad, right?。

Naturally, being bad doesn't warrant a penalty.，Plus my overall rating is just four or fifty，Then with my 40-50 overall rating, any insane plays I make，The system would find it completely reasonable.，Not to mention I start with my ultimate。

Even if my Lancelot builds Sunfire Cape，automatically breaking stealth when approaching an enemy, the system thinks it's completely reasonable，Playing Lancelot is just too good，Not as frustrating as the previous 'chicken claw' style play.，Kill anyone who pisses you off。

At most, I'll just give him a life back.，This attack speed and critical strike build for Lancelot is quite effective for pushing towers and slaying dragons.，Unfortunately, it just doesn't have much sustain.，The sustain from Skill 2 is still slightly lacking.，Lanling King's ultimate ability's super armor is just too effective。

Even if the sustain is sufficient, mana can easily run out，Under these circumstances, with no health and no mana, you can only go and feed one kill.，Quickly restore full health，What on earth is this Sun Ce trying to do? Never mind.，Take down the enemy's last defensive tower。

All teammates are here，Looks like we can finish them off in one push.，Go all in，Haven't gotten the kill yet，That's great。

I tried my best，I'm done for，economy lead，Died one more time before victory, a perfect ending.
