视频字幕：

The marksman said the offlane should pick someone tankier，because my Meng Tian is built for full damage output，No choice，had to switch to playing Liu Shan，Just kidding, Liu Chan is also built with full damage output.。

Although I didn't listen to a single word my teammates said，but at least the basic attitude is there，Just tell me if this isn't tanky enough，Hahaha hehe，Our teammate even gifted us minion skins。

Seems like a real pro，This free stuff that others have to pay for，Feels so good，Go straight up and take down this Li Xin，Looks like we can't take down his tower.。

Subtly let the jungler take the kill，Guangxin (Light form Li Xin) is too slow in providing backup，He simply doesn't provide backup, the teammates must take him down，your trembling look，Currently, no towers have been lost on the other two lanes.。

Only my lane has already pushed to the second tower.，Never stick to the sidelines, huh，This full-damage build demolishes towers so fast，Two people are ganking me，I tried my best。

Unstoppable power，I originally thought about buying a Tyrant's Armor just to show some effort，After all, my teammates asked me to tank the damage.，but at a glance，It seems I don't even need this to win。

Just saw a follower ask，a game that is about to be lost，prioritize maintaining your rating or go all out to win the match，It depends on the situation.，If a team fight。

your teammates might win, but most likely lose，but your participation would guarantee victory，Do you join in，Definitely not joining，Isn't there still a chance to win?。

Why should I join in the fun，What if this team fight is definitely a loss?，Then you can join in the fun，If you win, you'll directly secure the victory.，lose and die together with your teammates to share the rating。

equal share，In this unwinnable team fight, try to save at least one teammate and avoid a complete wipeout.，otherwise, I’ll be the one left to defend the base，Of course，The premise of joining the fight is that both sides are evenly matched in score。

not much difference，with the score at 6:20，Why even bother joining the fray，Just wait for the loss and it's over.，To sum it up in one sentence。

can add icing on the cake，but you can't provide help in times of need，otherwise you'll end up burned to ashes like charcoal，The score gap is too large，you don't need to think about winning。

If you die slowly, you'll be the MVP，In a situation like this, you're still thinking about turning the tables?，If you're not the prison player, then who is?，Who is the veteran player，An ally has been。

Some might wonder why Liu Chan isn't playing as a support anymore，That's because I was researching the support hero Shield Mountain a few days ago，nearly drove me crazy，Following the marksman, but they play like complete idiots.，I feel uncomfortable watching it。

The ADC plays too aggressively，Following him makes it too easy to pick up assists，It's better to go to the off lane，Out of sight, out of mind，Moreover, playing as a support in the off-lane also has its advantages.。

The kill score contribution of supports isn't very significant，It's okay if you accidentally kill someone.，You can take a look at Lanling King，Doing my best，Go
