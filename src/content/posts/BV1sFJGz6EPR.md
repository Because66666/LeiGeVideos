Currently my Meng Tian has a seven-game winning streak，Because the rating system for the hero Meng Tian is extremely abstract，so the overall rating can be suppressed to around 30，Since this overall rating is already extremely low，so it's impossible to match with normal players。

Even the so-called 'hardcore players' in these matches performed utterly abysmally，Li Xin's win rate dropped to 84%，There's no way around it，After the day I got the Team's Light，He made me win one and lose one。

purely screwing me over for three straight rounds，our team didn't have any refreshingly bad players，My teammates fed faster than I did.，and the marksman is always Li Yuanfang, making it completely unplayable，Fortunately, the 'Team's Light' was gone。

Everything is back to normal，This Team Light is absolutely problematic.，Although it was one win and one loss，But those three wins were also stolen victories.，Even the match with Zhao Yun was won by my sneaky tactics.。

almost failed to outmaneuver the opposing Li Xin，This Daruma is actually at max proficiency.，Actually, this Dharma is the opponent's jungler.，But this time the enemy jungler didn't take Smite，is a rogue cultivator。

jungle without smite，The support didn't buy the Nomad's Medallion，I collectively refer to them as rogue cultivators，In my opinion, the so-called 'Team Beacon' is just players electing their fellow prisoners.，As for the planner claiming there's no issue with the 'Team Beacon'。

The planner even claimed there are no bots.，Indeed, being a game planner requires a thick skin.，How could they say such nonsense，My teammate just fed a kill.，I also fed once, then the Monkey King came to gank for me。

Watch my technique, don't poke the enemy，Tried my best but didn't hit，Wait, how did I get an assist?，I don't seem to have dealt any damage, do I?，Something seems off。

Could Meng Tian also have some special mechanic that allows him to get assists?，like Arthur's first skill，Weird.，The score is now 2:7，Our marksman got completely crushed by the enemy。

Because our marksman is a cheapskate，It's already been 4 minutes，hasn't bought a single piece of equipment，Since the enemy jungler didn't bring Smite，so they have two top laners。

This is going to be quite troublesome to fight.，Thunder, ah，I can't believe it，I'm charging up to attack a minion here，He just jumped over and handed me a free kill。

but no big deal，Meng Tian's rating system is quite abstract.，Getting a single kill is no big deal，This Daruma is back again，Indeed none of them are human。

The jungler came to help me kill Da Mo，They came straight for the tower.，Our marksman just camps in the middle lane，No one is taking care of the top lane，He got crushed by Sun Shangxiang。

It's not because Sun Shangxiang is particularly skilled，but because our marksman was even worse than that Sun Shangxiang，He didn't buy any equipment for half the game，In the end, he directly bought a Blade of Despair，It turns out to be the Thunder Sect.。

Playing Meng Tian like this keeps the rating even lower，The people I'm matched with are getting more and more amusing.，I often encounter bans on Luban, Houyi, Xiao Qiao, Kai, and Monkey King.，Fortunately, no one banned Meng Tian.，No one bans Meng Tian in either high-rank or low-rank matches.。

Because this hero has an extremely low pick rate.，Most people have never even seen it，K an ally has been slain，Me Me child，Your team has destroyed。

A turret，Got caught with nowhere to run，The monkey is fighting the dragon over there，Definitely can't run towards the Monkey King，Fortunately, the people I matched with aren't that strong.。

Just run in the opposite direction，This Xiao Qiao at level 13 is chasing me, a level 14, trying to fight.，If I hadn't chosen not to kill him，he would've been dead already，Could I actually get away with this? I did my best.。

The enemy Daruma actually knows how to cut the minion wave，But even without minions, I can still push the high ground directly.，got hit by Xiaoqiao，There's nothing I can do about it，Damo is actually destroying the crystal。

Seems like a pro player，and also has a Blade of the Heptaseas，is even more of a pro player，He had been stealing on the top lane all along，suddenly switched to the bottom lane。

The enemy definitely won't react in time，It's a shame about the ultimate skill，just used it to attack the Lord，But even without the ultimate skill, I can still take down this crystal.
