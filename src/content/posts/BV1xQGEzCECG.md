Currently, I'm on an 8-game winning streak.，Look at this Dian Wei, he failed to out-smite me，I took the red buff，Now just circling around him，Right now my overall rating is too low。

Both teams' hardcore players only have a comprehensive score of around 60.，none of them are human，So there's no need to worry at all about his teammates coming over，Similarly, my teammates won't come either，This is a good thing。

to prevent teammates from coming over and giving me assists，Dian Wei is missing，must be coming to take the blue buff，Waiting here to ambush him while he takes the blue buff，He even knows to hide in the bushes。

Looks like he's learned to be smart，Unfortunately, he failed to out-smite me for the blue buff.，Come fight for our red buff, but he still lost the Smite battle to me.，He must be absolutely furious by now.，So at this moment, we're going to provoke him again.。

The red buff has respawned，He's coming for the red buff，The pangolin he just killed was also stolen by me.，You can see he's definitely tilted now，He wishes he could kill me。

He came back to kill the boar again，See if I can steal it，Smite the boar，What about your red buff?，With my movement speed maxed out, I directly ascend like a feather。

directly ascend with feathery flight，He can't possibly catch up with Me，I'm toying with him too much，He even knows to camp the shadow，Then I just won't go back, right?。

The current score is 4:0，We're dominating here.，Both junglers are practically nonexistent，perfectly fair，Look, how smart。

Go back and fight for him, giving it all.，A scoreline of 0-0-0, what an outstanding performance，easy to get a high score of around 3，I stole the enemy Sima Yi's red buff，He's now so angry that he's frozen in place。

I toyed with him using my first skill for a while, and then he went AFK.，The mentality is just too weak.，Classic map — classic NPC Kayn, I don't even need to use skills when playing against Kayn，Because he simply couldn't catch up with me，just circle around him on flat ground。

Easily drives the opponent crazy，He doesn't chase me，I'll just take his jungle camps，Even if he chases, he can't catch up，After all, I do have Smite.。

and the first skill also has crowd control，Stealing this red buff is still a piece of cake.，Right now he really wants to kill me，I've been circling with him for almost 5 minutes，He chose to take the red buff。

Then I'll gladly take it.，How did Kai die during the team fight，I was still waiting for Kai to come and take the blue buff.，Who will play with me now that Kai is dead，Ah
