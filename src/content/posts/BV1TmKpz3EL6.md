Why does your King rank match feel like a Gold rank game，Nonsense, how could this be like a Gold rank match?，Gold rank is way harder to play than this, okay?，Currently, there are only three scenarios in Gold tier matches，The first scenario is all smurfs。

absolutely unplayable，The second scenario is all locals，even with the use of chicken claw tactics，local Gold-tier noobs on your team，he also lacks the ability to take on five enemies alone。

Third, the rank is too low.，will encounter fellow chicken claw strategy players，no matter which situation，are extremely difficult to fight against，Now let's look at the King-tier matches。

local veteran players in the King rank, well-trained，well-prepared，taking on five opponents with ease，If he didn't have the ability to carry four noobs，can't 1v5。

He would still be stuck in Epic rank now.，And in the King tier, it's rare to encounter fellow chicken claw style players，As you climb higher in the ranks，Accounts with such low ratings are relatively rare，then you can't match with them。

they can only match you with AI bots，Moreover, as you climb higher in ranks，the more points you lose，the more points deducted，the more dedicated players dare not slack off on you。

Intentional Defeat Warning，The damage output of this Shaosiyuan is quite high，Just in time to let him have all the kills，let him go，Keep hitting and he'll die。

Just take down the tower.，Cannot bear to see it die after seeing it alive，Shao Siyuan actually didn't kill him，No need to dodge at all，I tried my best。

This Shaosiyuan's healing is surprisingly fast.，This actually worked，Sigh，It's great to have a support following behind to pick off kills，I just stand still auto-attacking。

Without moving a muscle, I got Shao Siyuan's assistance in an instant，actually managed to achieve a decent 2-3 score，What's more, I even gave the kills to Shaosiyuan.，Otherwise I'd be 4-3 now，got kicked out right at the 6-minute mark。

No wonder this Shao Siyuan is playing so well，And I've already played like this，He was still following me，So he wasn't even a human from the start，AFK for 6 minutes。

and then got kicked out，That makes sense，I knew it，How could I possibly be matched with such an amazing support，So it's a bot。

That explains it，Come push the tower，But Honor of Kings is really a dog game.，The consolation package after a teammate gets kicked out, whether it includes a score protection card or not，It seems to be random。

This game is afraid you'll rank up too quickly，always on guard against players，two hero fragments，Take it or leave it，Not enough? Here's another flower for you.。

In this utterly inhuman match，this kicked-out Shao Siyuan，that is, this AI bot，actually performed better than these real players，I have a smurf account and casually tested the chicken claw flow with 'The Prisoner'。

Bro，It turns out that Prisoner's first skill can no longer pass through walls，Both first skills hit the wall，Overall, the experience was that as soon as I activated my ultimate and frenzy, it immediately scattered the crowd.，Ah。

As soon as I activated my ultimate and Frenzy, everyone ran away.，Then I can quietly stay behind to destroy the turret，It's just that Prisoner's lousy first skill can't go through walls，Might as well play Houyi，Moreover, Prisoner's tower pushing speed feels really slow too.
