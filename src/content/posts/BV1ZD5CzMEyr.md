Someone in the comment section said Yaog's rating is hard to achieve，That's complete nonsense，1-14 and still got a 5.0 rating，0-12 also has a 5.0 rating，2-14, yet the rating is as high as 5.8.。

My teammates played seriously the entire match, only to find out，the rating is still lower than mine，Lancelot is a Legendary King，Seems like a pro，But what does being a Legendary King even mean。

Even a Legendary King can't carry the three of us，Don't judge me for my messy gameplay，but my win rate is high，Don't mind that I keep losing，All my losses are in casual matches。

But my ranked matches are on a winning streak，6-game winning streak, 7-game winning streak，and then another 8-game winning streak，Zhao Yun is a Glory King，I'm no match for him。

The matchmaking mechanism of Honor of Kings is quite considerate.，This is in the matching mode with the teleportation skill，Even feeding three kills in one minute won't get you reported，But sometimes you just can't lose even if you try，There's nothing to be done about it。

after all, losing too much，The system's mechanism is about to kick in，Not only do the opponents become extremely weak，your teammates will also become incredibly strong，Look at this match, I'm 0-4 in just 4 minutes。

but the score is 6:6，As the game progresses，The respawn time has also increased，This slowed down my feeding speed，I only fed 7 kills in 8 minutes。

Why is the enemy's damage so low?，Even so，our teammates are still in the lead，still leading in kills，I'm already 0-12 here。

still managed to push to the enemy's crystal，can't even lose if I try，forced to secure victory in the game，Now it's a situation where you can't lose even if you want to，If I keep playing, it's impossible to win even if I want to.。

In a guaranteed win, I don't exert effort，Because it makes no difference whether I'm there or not，The sweaty tryhard has already stomped the enemy team，No need to do the unlucky deed of increasing my rating.，I don't even try in guaranteed-win games。

In a guaranteed loss match, I won't even try harder.，Whether I'm here or not, this match is doomed to lose，What if I actually try hard，this round still didn't end in victory，not only will it prevent the next game from refreshing prison players。

It can also easily make you fume with anger.，Anyway, the respawn coins are unlimited，Just follow your teammates and feed together, that's it.，In evenly matched games, the score keeps alternating like 5:5, 9:9, 13:13，nine to nine。

The outcome could go either way，Now it's time for me to step up my game.，The Tiger Talisman effect lasts the entire match，This round is probably doomed，If I step up my game, there might still be a chance to win.。

after several team fights，after exerting effort，Why is it still a tie?，At this point，Just give up and go AFK.，Thought getting a few kills would improve everyone's situation，Never expected everyone to still be in dire straits
