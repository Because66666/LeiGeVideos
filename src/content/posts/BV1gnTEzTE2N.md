Go straight to contest the lane at the start，If you can seize the lane, immediately activate stealth，Preparing to intercept the second wave of minions，If you can't win the lane, just feed first blood，Clearly I've secured the first wave of minions.。

Go invisible immediately to cut off the second wave，Enemies are coming, I did my best，There's nothing that can be done，After respawning, teleport over immediately，Just focus on clearing the minion waves。

Only focused on minions and towers, and got caught again，Great，No worries about dying within the first 4 minutes，Because of the turret protection，He simply can't take down Me tower。

After 4 minutes, you must clear the minion wave before dying，otherwise the tower will be lost，Actually, it's a good thing for Lancelot to die a few more times.，For every two deaths, you can go and kill one person.，Kill according to a 1:2 ratio。

Your rating should be around 3-4 points.，Even if you trade kills at a 1:1 ratio, it's not a big problem，should be around 5.6 points. For You to attack those with high bounty levels，target those with level 3 or 4 bounties，One hit will burst out a large amount of gold。

and your teammates will also receive gold，Don't go after those trash worth only a few dozen coins，wasted a kill slot，If you manage to kill someone with a max bounty, you can get 550 gold.，and your four teammates, even if they are miles away。

did nothing，as long as the max bounty target dies，can also receive gold coins，This is because I'm using Han Xin to 1v4 against bots，the system judged me to be at a disadvantage。

so the gold dropped is a bit less，Normally all four players should receive over 100 gold coins，If your teammate can also secure an assist，even if it wasn't your teammate who got the kill，he can also get 240 gold。

This is also because Han Xin was judged to be at a disadvantage.，Otherwise, it should have been 275 gold.，If Han Xin is in the lead, the bounty gold will be much higher，instantly closed the gap of one to two thousand gold，This is why。

Despite your team being in a clear advantage with over a dozen more kills，just because your carry player died，the enemy's economy suddenly caught up，This is all because of your stubborn players, who gave the opponent a huge amount of gold.，Two hardcore players just gave away 2,000 gold。

Two veteran players just gave away 2000 gold，Of course they caught up，So some people might ask here，the max-bounty imprisoned player is way too overpowered，What if I can't defeat him?。

No worries，Our Claw Tactics players usually have scores like 0-something.，He can only get a few dozen gold at most if he kills me.，I killed him，we directly get an additional 1,000 bucks。

It's a sure profit anyway，On the other hand, if you are the hardcore player，your bounty level is too high，you better behave yourself，Otherwise, the blame for the defeat falls on you, and there's no need to say more.。

Many people have some misunderstanding about this bounty level，think that as long as you die，the bounty is reset，Dead wrong，Each death only reduces the bounty level。

unless the bounty level is very low，In other words, even if a max-bounty 'prisoner player' dies，he is still very valuable，Next time this high-bounty player dies, they'll still spill gold coins，My chicken claw strategy only feeds the enemy team a few dozen gold per death.。

A caged player's death gives the opposing team one to two thousand gold.，Who exactly is the noob among us，Who is the one actually making the opponents stronger，And who is the one feeding the enemy team，Also, although the full bounty will drop 550 gold。

but if the disadvantaged side kills the advantaged side，will trigger the economic catch-up mechanism，it will drop even more gold，What's this poor Yuan Ge chasing me for?，Just cash him out already。

Only 200 bucks，As for consecutive deaths，When consecutive deaths reach 8 or more，that is, when reaching 0-8 or above，will only be worth 20 gold。

basically means you can die freely，not even worth as much as a minion，So always prioritize high-value targets when attacking，let's earn money together，for example, this Annie just now，he had the maximum bounty
