1-13, millions retreat, tutorial on an unwinnable match，I've been on a winning streak these days, not losing a single game.，The Jews are naturally going to punish me.，This is definitely a losing game.，At the start, I solo-killed this completely inhuman Li Xin.。

Then our marksman and support died while the red buff was still alive，The two of them died first.，Luban was even more outrageous，died twice in one minute，Clearly this match is already unwinnable.。

Whoever takes it seriously is the clown.，Next round we'll definitely be trapped players, directly initiating Plan B，openly feeding in an unwinnable game to accelerate the deficit，You can feed as much as you want without getting reported，except for prisoners。

Prisoners doing this would be deliberately throwing the game，In a guaranteed loss match, you must remember，If you die too slowly, you'll end up being the MVP，fewer than one death per minute，You're just waiting to be the MVP。

Tried my best，Damn it, as soon as I respawned，The score is 2:8，two kills，one was me killing Li Xin。

The other kill was me bringing Li Xin down to two bars of health，picked up by Dian Wei，Luban has already gone 0-4，Looks like we're going to compete，Who among the world's heroes dares to challenge me?。

You have been enemy killing spree，Luban actually fed five kills，Looks like he really wants to go head-to-head with me，5 minutes 2:18, if I don't feed soon I'll really become the MVP，because I still have one kill。

A follower asked me，Why has Honor of Kings become like this now，Why not focus on competitive gameplay，You still don't get it?，Do you think the target audience of Honor of Kings。

Or are you still those competitive prison gamers?，Starting with pairing up a bunch of heroes, skins are being released more frequently than before，Not to mention the way they designed Sun Quan，The target audience of Honor of Kings is no longer you.，Your role is to lead their target audience to victory。

To put it nicely，You are the locomotive, leading everyone to victory at the forefront.，to put it bluntly，You're just like Xiangzi the rickshaw puller, toiling away，Of course, it's just a metaphor。

After all, Xiangzi even has a Beijing hukou，still has a house in Beijing，You're much worse off than him，You not only pulled the rickshaw for free without pay，There are also penalties。

Here's another detail，We cannot surrender，Why? As you can see, this surrender，only 4 people，indicating that one player has gone AFK。

But the Jews haven't given me the score protection card yet，How could I surrender?，As mentioned before，to get the Jews to kick someone out，You have to wait for this player to be AFK for 6 minutes first。

So now we're just stalling，wait for the system to issue the loss prevention card to us，we surrender，no compensation card，we will never surrender。

The current score is 4:35，It's quite common to piss someone off and make them AFK.，He went AFK，I'll get the point protection card，Even if the score is 5:41。

I would rather die than surrender，Retreat now，Now the team has exhausted all 6 surrender attempts，You can now safely wait for the Jews to hand out the point protection cards.，Wait for the disaster relief supplies to be distributed。

I'll surrender immediately，I finally waited for this day，We held out until the very last second when the Jews issued the point protection card，claimed the protection card just before the crystal exploded，If it had been just a few seconds later。

let the Jews' scheme succeed，we wouldn't have been able to claim the protection card，Okay, one more thing，Luban was too slow feeding kills, 1-12 is the MVP
