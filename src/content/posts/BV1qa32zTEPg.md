Since the jungler in this match is Lancelot，There's no other choice，I can only play Li Xin now，Playing Li Xin like this means you can't fight anyone at all，Li Xin's build in the new version has been optimized.。

This small item should prioritize attack speed first.，without pre-selecting it first，It will prioritize purchasing physical attack items.，Just forget about the Shadow Battle Axe.，Anyway, Li Xin can't fight people.。

What's the use of Shadow Tomahawk，Wish the damage to enemies could be even lower，After all, the tower's defense isn't that much anyway，As for Lan Ling Wang, he still needs the Shadow Battle Axe.，after all, Lanling Wang is capable of fighting enemies。

occasionally target enemies with high bounties，earn some bounties，In this game, my Li Xin doesn't need to kill anyone either，except for me, all four teammates have positive KDA，completely unnecessary for me。

I just need to focus on taking down towers.，Actually, at first I thought about going with Shadow Blade, Lightning Truncheon, and Force of Courage，simply max out the movement speed，Later in actual combat, I found that without Chicken Claw, I couldn't push the tower at all.，Ah。

You still need to get a Chicken Claw first，As for the Shadow Tomahawk，It's completely useless now，Now the Starbreaker doesn't provide penetration，Buying a small Meteor is useless now。

Jungle，In the past, we used to buy the cheapest equipment available.，Now the prices of equipment have been adjusted to be almost the same.，The cost-effectiveness of Frost Giant's Demise and Scourge is not as high as before.，Turret。

The entire enemy team is grouping up in the top lane.，An ally has been slain，An enemy，Go straight for the crystal，Those two still can't make it back。

Been slain，Your team has destroyed，The turret，This Sun Shangxiang is only level 11，struggling to kill a minion。

Damn it，It's still too hard to keep Li Xin's score low，So it's recommended to switch to playing Lancelot instead，It's very easy to achieve a score of three or four.，The only downside is that Lancelot cannot destroy towers without minions.。

rely on minions，but pushing towers isn't important，Keeping the score low is what matters，as long as the score is low，the opponent's IQ isn't high。

then pushing towers would be a piece of cake，It's strange why whenever I play Lancelot，our team always ends up with a Xiao Qiao，The Dominance effect is also quite helpful for pushing towers.，Thankfully, there's the Overlord's Power，otherwise it would be over
