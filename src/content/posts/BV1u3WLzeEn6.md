Many Followers tagged me to watch a video，AI-controlled characters using Smite to steal the blue buff in the bush，This is nothing new.，When I played the Chicken Claw strat last year，This thing existed even before the Chicken Claw strategy became popular.。

I've been saying this for a whole year，The officials never once paid attention to me，Last year, they didn't even bother to pretend anymore，For example, skills like Daji's second ability, which are targeted skills，He could actually hit someone in the bushes without vision。

Tell me this isn't cheating, what else could it be?，But this has already touched upon the classified files of Honor of Kings.，That's the AI bots，as long as you mention bot matches，The officials would absolutely never give a damn about you.。

When I mentioned the chicken claw strategy and bots, the official responded only about the chicken claw strategy，I mentioned the rating system and AI bots，he addressed the rating system，I mentioned the merit playstyle and AI bots，he responded to the virtue flow。

In short, as long as it involves bot matches，the official turns a selective deaf ear，can't hear at all，but not completely deaf，if you mention the characteristics of AI bots。

They fixed it the very next day.，I mentioned over a dozen methods to identify bot players，he fixed it so quickly，all fixed，It's fine to fix it。

He even played the 'left brain attacks right brain' game with me during the Live.，Actually, players using the 'Virtue Play' strategy can achieve such high ratings，because they performed exceptionally well in every aspect during the match，very humbly leading everyone to victory，The Virtue Playstyle requires a high level of skill and game sense.。

We sincerely appreciate players for developing gameplay styles like the 'Merit Play'.，After that, they completely nerfed Arthur's damage taken score and healing score.，Didn't you say I could win，Is it because of my skills and awareness?，Didn't you say my score was so good。

Is it because all my stats are exceptionally high?，Since my high score is due to my skills and awareness，Then why did you cut all my points?，Facing players' doubts，he also uttered those words。

We have found that some tanks intentionally build tank items，then deliberately take damage，This is something we don't want to see，I said it a long time ago，The words of the planner do not represent the company。

does not represent the game，does not represent the team，only represents his personal opinion，So you can't trust a single word the planner says，everything he promised you。

as soon as he gets fired，the next planner would never take care of it，because his words only represent his personal opinion，even if a planner pulls off an outrageous move，enraged the entire player base。

as long as he meets the performance targets，he won't be fired，At most, they would be transferred to another position.，employees who meet the performance targets，even employees who exceed their targets。

How could the boss possibly fire him?，Honor of Kings is essentially a massive pig-butchering scam，when you don't know how to play，when you're not interested in this game，he arranges a bunch of AI bots along with dedicated players to carry you。

making you think this game is actually quite fun，once you're hooked，start spending money on skins，start practicing skills diligently，after becoming a prisoner player。

you've completely fallen for it，The difference between Honor of Kings and a pig-butchering scam lies in the fact that，But the cyber pig-butchering scam is legal.，Honor of Kings still hasn't responded，probably can't come up with an explanation either。

Let me help you come up with a solution，You might as well claim all accounts with 20% extra economy are using hacks，Recently, a new type of hack has emerged in Honor of Kings，can change the album to temporarily show no records，can also gain an additional 20% economy，then randomly ban a few trapped players，claiming it to be an anti-cheat announcement
