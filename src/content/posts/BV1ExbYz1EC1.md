The ultimate form of the ELO system and AI bots is a prison in a fishbowl，All imprisoned players will be trapped in their own AI-controlled matches.，There is no hope for a comeback，Once they decide to punish you，directly pits you against 5 awakened AI opponents targeting you alone。

directly reduce you to a negative KDA score of zero kills and several deaths，Then you'll still think it's a problem with your skills，and start wondering if you've gotten worse at the game，These AI bots can even talk，and even taunt you。

Ordinary players simply cannot tell，completely unaware they're trapped in a bot match，Ultimately becoming a tool for planners to boost daily active users，Yet this situation already exists，Many people simply cannot recognize AI bots。

Because the new version of AI bots disguises themselves so realistically，You wouldn't believe there are AI players even in ranked matches, and the higher your composite score，the higher the rank，the bots you encounter will be smarter，performs almost indistinguishably from real human players in matches。

not as dumb as the bots encountered in low ratings，You，Now the matches you're playing，Almost every match has AI players，The officials avoid talking about the bot issue。

because they intend to turn Honor of Kings into an EVE-like game，Their strategy is quite simple，It's like the ostrich burying its head in the sand，then there are no AI players，as long as they keep silent about the bot issue。

Then it doesn't exist，as long as the AI bots are made to resemble real players，as long as players can't tell，That counts as a real player. I tried my best, but Huang Zhong ambushed me from the fog of war and secured the kill.，Huang Zhong deals significant damage in the mid-to-late game。

I'm no match for him.，Prioritize breaking the enemy's high ground at 11 minutes，I tried my best but got caught by the T0 marksman Huang Zhong.，You have been slain，Fortunately, I'm best at making a comeback from a disadvantage.。

Teammates are team fighting，I'm split pushing here，The enemy jungler is coming to gank me，Great，The enemy jungler didn't join the team fight either。

Very fair，There's no way a Nakoruru can catch up to me.，I've stacked up to 8 movement speed，Shut down，Did my best. How is the birdman back again?。

I thought he had left.，This 8 movement speed is really useful，and it's upgraded to 10 movement speed，My other equipment also increases movement speed，can even turn back to hit him。

stealing turret with precision，I've done my best，Prime Minister, we're counting on you，Killing spree
