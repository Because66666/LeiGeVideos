Due to the major changes in the next version of the Blade of the Seven Seas，It feels necessary to rush a Frostfang at the start，Since the next version of the Blade of the Heptaseas will add an attack speed attribute，with both attack speed and physical attack，are all crucial attributes for tower pushing。

and the next version of the Blade of Despair requires stacking this passive，The passive effect increases duration by only 0.01 seconds every 5 seconds.，When fully stacked, you gain 2.5 seconds of invincibility time，from the moment you purchase the Blade of the Hegemon until its stacks are fully accumulated，It takes you twelve and a half minutes to fully stack。

In other words, even if you rush to buy the Blade of the Immortal at the start of the game，It will probably take over 16 minutes for it to fully stack.，When the passive effect of the Blade of the Hegemon activates, it also increases attack speed and movement speed，extremely useful，I think it's often more useful than the revival armor.。

The revival armor might just mean dying again，But this Demonblade offers 2.5 seconds of invincibility，and increases movement speed，In the future, taking Demon Blade and Chicken Claw to backdoor will be such a delightful thing.，Next are the Lightning Dagger and the End, the Lightning Dagger has added physical attack。

Previously, people didn't use Lightning Saber because it was easy to accidentally get assists.，and the lack of physical attack would affect tower-pushing speed，Now it has added physical attack，but it's still easy to get assists，may still not be very useful。

The Corrosion Scythe now adds 100-200 points of fixed damage，It's unclear whether this will have any effect on towers.，If it works on towers, it would be extremely effective.，Frostbrand can be directly phased out，As for the new lifesteal blade's skill that allows lifesteal。

This is not very useful for the 'chicken claw' playstyle.，mainly because there's no attack speed，The physical attack is not particularly high either.，Now the Corrosion Scythe also provides 20% lifesteal，fully sufficient。

The final piece of equipment that caught my eye was the Imperial Jade Seal，took a glance at the stats，Another look and it explodes，666 without even pretending，Attack speed 180。

Just as I was still thinking，I took a look at his actual gameplay video，found that this thing's attack speed is actually only 20，only 20% attack speed，Never mind then，The effect is to randomly grant you a buff，Let's see what specific buffs there are first, then evaluate its usefulness.
