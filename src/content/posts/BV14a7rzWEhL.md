The chicken claw strategy works fine during regular play，In promotion matches, it's always one win followed by one loss.，Teammates are utterly useless，What should I do，Recently, some followers told me。

He's currently stuck at Star Crest I and has already played the promotion match four times.，haven't passed，The win rate has just dropped to 70.，If you lose again, it will only be 69.，Actually, your issue。

It also happened when the chicken claw strategy first became popular last year，So I believe that in promotion matches，should use a different matchmaking mechanism compared to normal games，We, the chicken claw strategy players, are quite sensitive to the matchmaking mechanism.，Normally teammates are all useless。

the opponents are not human either，This is perfectly normal，but once it's a promotion match，It's just that our team is terrible，the opponents are still human。

Too obvious，The jungler is coming to gank for me，Tried my best but didn't hit it，Ah，Solo kill, 666. Let's circle back to the topic.。

In this situation，I suggest you just get a gold medal and skip it，For example, when you're at four stars in Glory rank，Just use a gold medal to skip this promotion match, and it's all good, isn't it?，Like last year when there was no MVP bonus star。

had no choice but to tough it out，This year, there's also the gold medal.，Surely some people are curious，This round got gold medal，what about the next match。

That naturally doesn't matter，As mentioned before，your comprehensive score is just 40-50，even if you kill forty or fifty in a single match，it's impossible to push the rating up to seventy or eighty。

as long as you don't keep dominating，just keep the rating from getting too high，out of mana，Ask Li Xin to help me regain the blue buff，Blue an en。

Let me give you an example，There was a multiple-choice question that was extremely difficult，highly deceptive，Only one underachiever in the class got it right，The teacher would definitely think he guessed it, right?。

So, it's no big deal if you occasionally dominate one or two games.，a blind cat happens upon a dead mouse，it's inevitable to get a couple of questions right，Isn't this quite normal?，Just don't let the teacher notice.。

For example, even though your exam scores are at the bottom every time，but you got all the hardest questions right，got all the easy questions wrong，The teacher could tell at a glance that you were deliberately manipulating your scores.，Just cashed out the Li Xin who was laning against me.。

raised for so long，It's time to kill，Let's cash out this Hou Yi as well，Lanling King is so convenient，only 200 bucks。

Is this Dong Huang Tai Yi even human?，I'm here slaying the dragon，He's auto-attacking here，It seems this guy is still the MVP on our team，It shows that there aren't many real players on the opposing team either.。

In a bot match like this，Getting a gold medal in promotion matches is incredibly easy，even if you occasionally get a gold medal，the system would surely think the opponents were just too weak，but not because I'm too strong。

The moment to strike，Why aren't you leaving yet，There's a Liu Chan and Li Xin on the enemy team, and it took me almost 15 minutes to sneak attack the high ground.，This Liu Chan is about to revive，That's strange, where's Li Xin?。

easy task，I'm really fed up，Why do I always encounter this basic attack Dong Huang whenever I go for the dragon?，See if we can sneak in and take down the middle lane's third tower.，This Xi Shi is really annoying。

Not team fighting, just keeps defending the tower，You wanna die, don't you?，Before I didn't attack him，he thought I couldn't beat him，chasing me with his ultimate ability。

My Lancelot now has the highest economy on the entire field，from 0-4 to 4-4，Just triggered the third-level bounty status，If this were Li Xin on a killing spree, it would definitely be game over.，Fortunately, it's Lian Po。

a 1:1 KDA like 4-4，It's impossible to get a high score，What on earth is this Luban trying to do?，The original bond is gone，I'll come over and take this dragon.，Finish them off directly, with a rating of only 5.4，It's even lower than my 0-6 Li Xin's score.
