视频字幕：

Player: How could Sun Quan have a wife? ，Honor of Kings: Changed, immediately changed. Sun Quan is now a single man who's been alone for 2,000 years.，has been a single old bachelor for 2000 years，Bulian will also be deleted immediately. Player: This matchmaking system is so disgusting, giving me such bot teammates after just a small winning streak.，We'll fix it, we'll fix it, we'll fix it, we'll fix it, we'll fix it.。

Player: This matchmaking system is so disgusting, please be patient and wait. Player: Why are there so many bots in this game?，up to the peak tournament，There are bots even down to the Showbiz mode.，Honor of Kings official wish feedback，The intention of Honor of Kings' official team is already very clear。

If you don't wake up now, when will you, imprisoned player?，Tried my best but gave away two kills in one minute，Now the so-called 'prisoner players' still have some use，is just like Xiangzi pulling a rickshaw，but it won't be long。

The living space of dedicated players will be further compressed，Just like Xiangzi's rickshaw being replaced by technology，Trapped players will soon be replaced by technology as well，Now when you suffer too many consecutive defeats，you will encounter matches like this。

Guess what, the opposing team is a full AI team with 5 bots.，Why do they have to insert a bot into your team?，Of course it's used to replace the 'prisoner players'，This AI is an Awakening AI，to prevent the four of you from having a mental breakdown due to consecutive losses。

even losing to five AI opponents，So the system thoughtfully added an enlightened AI bot to your team，to carry you to victory，I believe many of you have also encountered this situation—your AFK teammate suddenly plays exceptionally well，and even won the MVP。

That's because the system thinks you're too weak，If this AI teammate isn't strong enough，The daily active count wouldn't even reach 10 minutes，You were defeated in less than 10 minutes.，How can this be acceptable?。

AI bots are gradually replacing the position of persistent players.，Soon the game won't need hardcore players anymore，It's just that the technology isn't advanced enough yet.，When the technology advances, it will evolve into this situation.，fighting against 5 awakened AI opponents。

Truly unskilled players will be carried by the awakened AI in a one-carry-four scenario，After all, long-suffering players may have poor hand-feel，poor network connection, or emotional breakdown leading to intentional defeat，thus unable to carry four noobs，If they were replaced by Awakening AI, there would be no issue of being unable to carry the team.。

The current score is 1:8，This Zhuang Zhou keeps going AFK from time to time，Looks like this match is going to be quite a challenge.，All three lanes have completely collapsed.，only the Daji at the beginning got a kill。

only 1,000 gold behind，When my imperial seal comes out，You'll be saved，Right now my 0-5 Luban is the top earner，It seems my teammates in this match are indeed not up to par.。

But it's okay，The Jewish player will soon trigger the economic catch-up mechanism.，The canyon stands on the side of justice，Just ignore him，The Jews are testing my stress tolerance.。

as long as you show a little strength，will definitely become a trapped player，Other mechanics in this game are just terrible，but the mechanism for capturing 'imprisoned players' is quite effective，Tried my best but got ganked by the jungler。

Here come the details，give the kill to Ironclad，let him be the trapped player，An enemy has been slain，Then follow him to take down the tower。

You can see Hou Yi running towards us，We need to quickly take down the tower.，Then use the teleport to get out of here，Kuang Tie can just wait to die here，The enemy jungler is also coming。

Great, the entire enemy team is heading top lane，I'm heading to the bottom lane to push, doing my best. The score is 6:19.，The score is six to nineteen，The enemy still has a dragon, and we're at a huge disadvantage.，but what I excel at is turning the tide in desperate situations。

Destroyed the enemy's high ground at 11 minutes，Our Zhuang Zhou has gone AFK again，but don't worry about him，Because of Honor of Kings' mechanism, it takes 6 minutes after going AFK，other players can receive compensation。

That is to say, I have to wait until 18 minutes to get the protection card now.，longer than the lifespan of a Jew，Don't want to give players compensation，You're clearly afraid of players gaining any advantage, just say it outright，This can't even be detected。

This mechanism is utterly useless，Although the game's detection mechanism has always been like this，but rest assured，it will never change，Because it relies on such players to counterbalance the 'prisoner players'。

if the detection mechanism were truly improved，Wouldn't the win rate of those trapped players increase then?，Then who will boost the daily active users for the planners?，So just play this game casually，The in-game violation detection system is trash, and the cheat detection is also trash.。

The matchmaking system is still a mess，only the recharge mechanism is well-developed，Don't bother telling the planners about anything other than recharge matters，he won't hear you anyway，You're just a gamer。

No matter how well you hone your gaming skills，is not as good as spending some money on the game，The developers won't pay attention to you.，I think the time is about right，The time has come。

Rise up today，After 15 minutes of observation，There are very few people in the bottom lane, as long as we eliminate this Houyi，we can secure the victory，Because it's been 15 minutes。

This Hou Yi didn't participate in a single team fight，fighting stubbornly in the bottom lane just like me，And this bottom lane only has Hou Yi alone，Now the Hou Yi has been killed by me，His teammates simply don't care about the bottom lane, easily securing a comeback from behind.，Sigh，Why is he attacking minions when I clicked the turret push button?，Fortunately, it doesn't affect the outcome.
