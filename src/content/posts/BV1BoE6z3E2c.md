After extensive practical testing，I found that we claw-style players are still too poor，Currently at 4 minutes, the interference is at the second tier，Interference reaches its maximum level at the 10-minute mark.，Since the new version of Chicken Claw lacks penetration。

so you need to buy a small Meteor，After that, you can directly go to destroy the tower.，But this is just too expensive，because the Meteor costs over 900 coins，Rounding up, it's practically a 1,000-gold equipment.。

Without Meteor, you can't take down this tower.，by the time Li Xin can afford these pieces of equipment，probably after 10 minutes，which means the interference has reached level two，At this point, it's definitely possible to take down the high ground.。

To reduce costs，After my testing，can replace the Blade of the Heptaseas with the Swift Boots，Swift Spear not only increases attack speed by 20 points，and its passive also consistently increases basic attack damage by 40 points。

Of course, the most important reason is that it's cheap.，Where would us chicken-claw style players get so much money from?，If it weren't for being cheap，I would never buy the Punishment，Taking down the high ground turret is a piece of cake.。

Later, upgrade one to Shadow Battle Axe，upgrade to Endless Battle, and buy Wind Blade in the last slot，At this point, the attack speed is already maxed out，overflowed，so you can sell Frostbrand。

switch to Endless Battle，By now the tower should be pretty much pushed down.，Switch to this to make it easier to slay the dragon，Even with turrets, demolishing them with six fully-equipped items is effortless.，Ah。

Now let's look at Meng Tian. Li Xin's gameplay is still too difficult.，Let's take a look at the foolproof operation of Meng Tian，First, the new version of Meng Tian only needs two pieces of equipment，can now demolish towers without minion waves，Now look at the time。

It's only been 2 minutes since the game started.，Interference is at its weakest at level one，Charge straight ahead，First, Meng Tian tanks the tower，can take down the tower。

let the minions take the tower aggro，can still take down the tower，Now it's still the weakest interference，Of course, the difference between Meng Tian and Li Xin is that Meng Tian farms gold too slowly，prone to being reported。

and moves slowly，often tends to give their all，Since only two pieces of equipment are needed to demolish towers，so you can fully supplement with damage-dealing equipment later，defeat a 50,000 HP Storm Dragon。

This Meng Tian's dragon-slaying speed is decent in the late game.，Similarly, the cost can be further reduced to just a 'chicken claw' paired with a small and large iron sword.，It's only one minute into the game now, and the interference is still at its weakest.，As long as you don't mind losing stamina，You can definitely play Meng Tian。

Rune choices don't matter，Attack speed, full penetration, crit, or even thousand HP are all viable.，The priority is in the order I mentioned.，The effect of Thousand HP Runes is the best we can do，so it comes last
